  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>In offering this little book to my professional
brethren, I do not for one moment
wish it to be understood that I claim any
originality in the surgical treatment herein
described.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having read with great interest the Lectures
on the “Physiology and Pathology of the
Central Nervous System,” delivered by Dr.
Brown-Séquard before the Royal College of
Surgeons of England, in 1858, and published
in <cite>The Lancet</cite>, I was struck with a fact much
insisted upon by the learned physiologist,
namely, the great mischief which might be
caused in the system generally, and in the
nervous centres especially, by peripheral excitement.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>Constantly engaged in the treatment of
diseases of the female genitals, I had been often
foiled in dealing successfully with hysterical
and other nervous affections complicating
these lesions, without being able to assign a
satisfactory cause for the failure. Dr. Brown-Séquard’s
researches threw a new light on
the subject, and by repeated observation I
was led to the conclusion that the cases
which had puzzled me, and defied my most
carefully-conceived efforts at relief, depended
on peripheral excitement of the pudic nerve.
I at once subjected this deduction to a
surgical test, by removing the cause of excitement.
I have repeated the operation again
and again, and it is the object of this book
to show the results.</p>

<p class='c008'>Daily experience convinces me that all
unprejudiced men must adopt, more or less,
the practice which I have thus carried out;
and I have no doubt that, in properly
selected cases, it will prove as successful
in their hands as in mine.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>It will be observed that the majority of
the cases I publish have been taken from
the records of the London Surgical Home.
I have drawn my illustrations chiefly from
this source, because the practice of the
Institution being freely open to the profession,
the cases have been observed by numerous
medical men; and, I may add, that
many have become firm converts to my
views.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>As the title of this book implies, I do not intend
to occupy the attention of my readers with all
the numerous varieties of insanity and other nervous
disorders to which females are liable, but only those
which I believe to be curable by surgical means;
nor is it my intention in this category to include
slight cases, but to confine myself to such as cause
more or less severe functional derangement, or which
lead to serious organic lesions.</p>

<p class='c008'>The class of diseases on which I shall dwell are
those depending on (or arising from) a loss of
nerve tone, caused by continual abnormal irritation
of a nerve centre.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is no very new theory; but it has been for
Dr. Handheld Jones, by a large number of cases and
experiments, as collated in his admirable work on
“Functional Nervous Disorders,”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a> to make it “abundantly
clear that the great majority of disorders we
have to treat at the present time show more or less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>marked indications of failure of nervous power.”
Dr. Jones confines himself  “to such disorders as are
termed functional;”  and I agree with him that “it
seems a vain dispute, whether in strict accuracy
there are, or are not, any such disorders;&nbsp;... for
it is perfectly certain that there are very grave disorders
in which the most careful scrutiny fails to
detect any actual change, in which complete recovery
is perfectly possible, and in which the ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">juvantia</span>’ are
such as to operate more in modifying the power of
the organs than the texture.” Dr. Jones then gives
two typical cases of functional and organic disease,
between which, as he justly observes, “there intervene
numerous instances of more or less mixed
character;” and adds, that “disease which commences
essentially as functional may end as organic.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. London, Churchill, 1864.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>I am so pleased to be supported by my old friend
and colleague in views that I myself have long entertained,
that I intend, without further preface, to make
his researches the whole substratum of my work;
and hope to show how, on the basis of Dr. Jones’s
experiments, it is possible to prove the philosophy
of my own practice.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whichever of the terms, “inhibitory influence”
(Handfield Jones and Lister), “reflex relaxation”
(Brinton), or “reflex paralysis” (Brown-Séquard),
be used, the fact is ceded by all, that “the energetic
operation of an afferent nerve” (Lister), or some
impression acting injuriously on an afferent nerve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>(Handfield Jones), or, again, “an actually existing
irritation”  (Brown-Séquard), exerts an injurious
effect on its nerve centre, this state being, as Dr.
Brown-Séquard thinks, increased or diminished according
to the activity of the irritation, and ceasing
with its entire removal, or, more probably, as Dr.
Handfield Jones affirms, persisting after the cessation
of the cause which has morbidly affected it. This
latter view appears to me the more generally correct
one, because it can hardly be expected that a gradual
disease will be suddenly removed, there having been
no time for recovery of nerve power.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Dr. Handfield Jones’s Lumleian Lectures, delivered
last year before the College of Physicians, he thus
sums up his views on this subject:—“The essential
idea of the inhibitory theory is, that an impression
conveyed to a nervous centre by afferent nerves may
weaken or paralyze, instead of exciting, its action,
either from the congenital or acquired debility and
sensitiveness of the nerve itself, or because the impression
is unduly intense or absolutely injurious.
Both these things have in every case to be considered—viz.,
the state of the nerve force, and the kind
and amount of impression, as the resulting phenomena
will vary with the variation of either.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Jones next takes it as a matter of certainty,
“that a nervous centre may be more or less completely
paralyzed without having undergone organic
change, in consequence of some enfeebling morbid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>influence;” and quotes from Dr. Gull<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a> “a most
interesting instance of complete paraplegia induced
by sexual excess, in which nothing abnormal could
be detected in the cord, even by careful microscopy.
This was paralysis from simple exhaustion.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. “Guy’s Hospital Reports,” 1858. Case xvii.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Still continuing, Dr. Jones draws attention to the
anatomical fact of the remarkably close manner in
which “the different nerve centres, or parts of a nerve
centre, are connected by commissural fibres,” and
how, “from a pathological point of view, the same
connexion is often very manifest. The general exhaustion
induced by excess of venery,” and other
cases, “are examples which show how excessive
consumption of nerve force in one part weakens it
also in others; and this can only be adequately
explained by the intricate commissural connexion
between the various centres.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The truth of all these views is well exemplified, as
Dr. Kidd has stated, in cases of epilepsy, which “may
originate only in irritation of bad teeth acting on
the brain, or worms irritating the nerves of the
stomach, and so on as to other peripheral irritations;
the chief skill being to find out the spot from which
the irritation radiates.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A case is also quoted by Dr. Jones, in the Lumleian
Lectures, as having occurred in the practice of
Mr. Castle, of New York, where diseased teeth produced
paraplegia, which soon ceased after their removal.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Long and frequent observation convinced me that
a large number of affections peculiar to females, depended
on loss of nerve power, and that this was
produced by peripheral irritation, arising originally
in some branches of the pudic nerve, more particularly
the incident nerve supplying the clitoris, and
sometimes the small branches which supply the
vagina, perinæum, and anus.</p>

<p class='c008'>Closer observation satisfied me that the greater or
less severity of the functional affections observed, depended
on the amount and length of irritation, and the
consequent amount of loss of nerve power.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nor are functional disorders the only consequence,
but in some cases, severe organic lesions.</p>

<p class='c008'>The progress of the disease may be divided into
eight distinct stages—No. 8 being arrived at, by
gradations more or less distinct, directly from No. 1.</p>

<p class='c011'>1. <span class='sc'>Hysteria</span> (including dyspepsia and menstrual
irregularities).</p>

<p class='c011'>2. <span class='sc'>Spinal Irritation</span>, with reflex action on uterus,
ovaries, &amp;c., and giving rise to uterine displacements,
amaurosis, hemiplegia, paraplegia, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>My statement, that death is indeed the direct
climax of the series, might be proved by several cases
which have occurred in my own practice, one only of
which I shall relate. Before doing so, I may mention
that Dr. James Russell, of Birmingham, has recorded
a case in the <cite>Medical Times and Gazette</cite>, Oct. 31, 1863,
in which a male patient, æt. 32, died under his care
in the Birmingham General Hospital. Complete
paralysis both of sensation and motion in the lower
part of the body and lower extremities attacked him
after an unusually excessive venereal indulgence.
There had been gradual exhaustion for the last twelve
or fourteen years, from this cause. There was no
attempt at recovery, and he died in four months
from the date of the attack.</p>

<p class='c008'>The case that occurred in my own practice
was as follows:&nbsp;——, æt. 19, has been gradually
becoming ill since the age of nine; does not look
older than the latter age, though the sexual organs
are as highly developed as they should be. Has
been for many months in a metropolitan hospital
suffering from acute headache, but has received no
benefit. For two years has been perfectly blind.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was found dead, and with every evidence of
having expired during a paroxysm of abnormal excitement.</p>

<p class='c008'>These cases will illustrate how important it is to
arrest the disease <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ab initio</span></i>, and the treatment must
be the same whether we wish to cure functional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>disturbance, arrest organic disease, or, finally, if we
have only a chance, of averting death itself.</p>

<p class='c008'>The time required for recovery must depend, not only,
as has been already hinted, on the duration of illness,
but also on the peculiar temperament of the patient,
and judicious after-treatment; this latter requiring
long perseverance on the part of both practitioner
and the friends of his patient; and it is as we
meet a favourable or unfavourable case that the
opinions of Brown-Séquard, as to instant cure on
removal of irritation, or of Handfield Jones, as to
cure after a long interval, are verified.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have pleasure in stating that, with reference to
the origin of most nervous affections of females, I
have, in frequent conversation with Brown-Séquard,
found that the views of this distinguished physiologist
entirely coincide with my own, and he often expressed
himself as satisfied that destruction of the nerve
causing irritation was the only effective cure; the
best mode of carrying out this destruction was, in
his opinion, yet to be determined. He used actual
cautery.</p>

<p class='c008'>I hope to be able to show that a far more
humane and effectual method is that which I constantly
practise, and for the last six or seven years
have openly and consistently advocated. Of course,
from the very novelty of these views, I have been
met with many objections, such as unsexing the
female, preventing the normal excitement consequent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>on marital intercourse, or actually, as some most
absurdly and unphilosophically assert, causing sterility:
whereas my cases will show fact to be directly
converse to all these theories; and it is curious that
a physician for many years connected with one of
our largest metropolitan hospitals, and recognized as
a standard writer on female diseases, has in writing
condemned my practice in not very measured terms,
but is himself constantly in the habit of trying to
subdue this peripheral irritation by continual application
of the strongest caustics to the seat of the
irritation; thereby showing that he recognizes the
source of evil, but is not yet able to see that a
superficial sore will not destroy deep-seated nerve
irritation. It wants, I imagine, little argument to
prove that so far from this practice being beneficial,
it is likely, by causing increased irritation, to be positively
injurious.</p>

<p class='c008'>Other practitioners follow Dr. Brown-Séquard’s plan
of applying actual cautery to the irritant nerve; and
many more have advanced as far as the operation—which
I was formerly in the habit of practising—subcutaneous
division of the nerve. I have long abandoned
this method as being no more certain in its effect than
kindred operations on various branches of the fifth
nerve for <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tic doloureux</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another objection has been made that several of
my cases have not been permanently cured, but have
had relapses in a few weeks or months. This must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>necessarily be so with all new methods of treatment;
but each such case is of incalculable importance, as
teaching me to exclude any but temporary hope of
relief to some, while to others I can speak all the
more positively as to their ultimate permanent recovery.</p>

<p class='c008'>Experience seems to teach that in those patients
whose brains have been so weakened by long-continued
peripheral excitement, causing frequent and increasing
losses of nerve force, there is not sufficient
mental power to enable them to control any less powerful
irritation of smaller branches of the pudic nerve,
than that removed by operation.</p>

<p class='c008'>This lesser excitement acts chiefly, I imagine, by
preventing restoration, in the same manner as a
drunkard whose brain is weakened by long indulgence
in his baneful habit cannot resist temptation, but is,
however, affected by much smaller quantities of
stimuli, than when strong, he was able to take.</p>

<p class='c008'>A striking instance of this kind occurred to me last
year.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of our most distinguished obstetric physicians
requested me to operate on a lady who had been for
some twenty years under very many eminent practitioners
without any but temporary benefit. The
result of the operation was most marked; the irritation
subsided, the patient improved in health, and we
confidently expected permanent relief. Yet in a few
weeks after she left our hands and that of the nurse,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>irritation, resembling pruritus, gradually returned, and
with it the other old symptoms.</p>

<p class='c008'>In all cases of a similar nature which have come
under my care, I have insisted on the importance of
the patient being kept for a long time under careful
medical watching and good nursing, and from the
results already obtained from cases in which these
precautions have been exercised, I feel confident of
success for the future.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lastly, objections have been advanced against the
morality of the operation, and I am here at a loss how
to give an answer, for I can hardly conceive how such a
question can be raised against a method of treatment
which has for its object the cure of a disease, that is
rapidly tending to lower the moral tone, and which
treatment is dictated by the loftiest and most moral
considerations. I may here observe, that before commencing
treatment, I have always made a point of
having my diagnosis confirmed by the patient or her
friends.</p>

<p class='c008'>To the philosophical and charitable mind, indeed,
the whole subject is one of the greatest interest, and
will lead us to ask the question, may not this “inhibitory
influence,” originating in early life, act so powerfully
on the mind as to unhinge it from that steadiness
which is essential to enable it to keep the passions
under control of the will; to enable, indeed, the moral
tone to overcome abnormal excitement? And if this
be true, does not common charity lead us to think that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>cases treated by friends and spiritual advisers, as controllable
at the will of the individual, may be in reality
simply cases of physical illness amenable to medical
and surgical treatment? Is it not better to look the
matter steadily in the face, and instead of banishing
the unhappy sufferers from their home and from society,
endeavour to check their otherwise hopeless career
towards some of the latter stages of this disease, to restore
their mental power, and make them happy and
useful members of the community?</p>

<p class='c008'>On this consideration I shall not now dwell further.
Every one must feel it to be a vast and important one,
affecting the well-being of the whole human race.</p>

<p class='c008'>All I am now aiming at, is to show that many, if not
all, such cases may be cured. If this is done, I shall
indeed be able to say that I am amply repaid.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have the gratification of being able to name the
following gentlemen who have been led to adopt my
views and treatment in proper cases:—Sir James
Simpson; Dr. Beattie, of Dublin; Sir John Fife and
Dr. Dawson, of Newcastle-on-Tyne; Dr. Duke, late
of Chichester; Dr. Shettle, of Shaftesbury; John
Harrison, Esq., of Chester; Drs. Savage, Routh, and
Rogers, in London; my eldest son, Mr. Boyer Brown,
now practising in New South Wales; with my colleagues
in the “London Surgical Home,” Dr. Barratt,
and Messrs. Harper, Chambers, I. B. Brown, junior,
and Bantock, and very many others.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <span class='large'>SYMPTOMS AND PROGRESS OF DISEASE—AGE AND CLASS OF PATIENTS TO BE TREATED—OPERATION—AFTER-TREATMENT, ETC.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Every medical practitioner must have met with
a certain class of cases which has set at
defiance every effort at diagnosis, baffled every treatment,
and belied every prognosis. He has experienced
great anxiety and annoyance, and felt how
unsatisfactory was his treatment to the friends of
his patient: and this, not so much because he was
ignorant of the cause, as that he was unable to
offer any hope of relief.</p>

<p class='c008'>The period when such illness attacks the patient
is about the age of puberty, and from that time up
to almost every age the following train of symptoms
may be observed, some being more or less marked
than others in the various cases.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient becomes restless and excited, or
melancholy and retiring; listless and indifferent to
the social influences of domestic life. She will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>fanciful in her food, sometimes express even a distaste
for it, and apparently (as her friends will say)
live upon nothing. She will always be ailing, and
complaining of different affections. At first, perhaps,
dyspepsia and sickness will be observed; then pain
in the head and down the spine; pain, more or less
constant, in the lower part of the back, or on either side
in the lumbar region. There will be wasting of the face
and muscles generally; the skin sometimes dry and
harsh, at other times cold and clammy. The pupil will
be sometimes firmly contracted, but generally much
dilated. This latter symptom, together with a hard
cord-like pulse, and a constantly moist palm, are,
my son informs me, considered by Mr. Moore, Colonial
Surgeon of South Australia, pathognomonic
of this condition. There will be quivering of the
eyelids, and an inability to look one straight in the
face. On inquiring further, there is found to be
disturbance or irregularity in the uterine functions,
there being either complete cessation of the catamenia,
or too frequent periods, generally attended with
pain; constant leucorrhœa also frequently existing.
Often a great disposition for novelties is exhibited,
the patient desiring to escape from home, fond of becoming
a nurse in hospitals, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sœur de charité</span>,” or
other pursuits of the like nature, according to station
and opportunities.</p>

<p class='c008'>To these symptoms in the single female will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>added, in the married, distaste for marital intercourse,
and very frequently either sterility or a tendency to
abort in the early months of pregnancy.</p>

<p class='c008'>These physical evidences of derangement, if left unchecked,
gradually lead to more serious consequences.
The patient either becomes a confirmed invalid, always
ailing, and confined to bed or sofa, or, on the other
hand, will become subject to catalepsy, epilepsy,
idiotcy, or insanity. In any case, and more especially
when the disease progresses as far as these latter
stages, it will almost universally be found that there
are serious exacerbations at each menstrual period.</p>

<p class='c008'>On personal examination, the peculiar straight and
coarse hirsute growth; the depression in the centre of
the perinæum; the peculiar follicular secretion; the
alteration of structure of the parts, mucous membrane
taking on the character of skin; and muscle having
become hypertrophied and generally tending towards
a fibrous or cartilaginous degeneration; will all be
recognized by the practitioner who has once had his
attention drawn to these subjects.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having ascertained the cause and nature of the
disease, there are one or two points to be considered
before operative measures are decided on.</p>

<p class='c008'>First, as to age. Although there is no doubt that
patients may suffer from peripheral irritation of the
pudic nerve from the earliest childhood, I never operate
or sanction an operation on any patient under ten
years of age, which is the earliest date of puberty.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>In children younger than this, milder treatment with
careful watching, will be found sufficient if it be
thoroughly persevered in.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are again, after puberty, cases which give
rise to but slight disturbance, but in which the sufferers
are they who love to enlist sympathy from the charitable,
and will be ill, or affect to be ill, in spite of any
and every treatment.</p>

<p class='c008'>When I have decided that my patient is a fit subject
for surgical treatment, I at once proceed to operate,
after the ordinary preliminary measures of a warm
bath and clearance of the portal circulation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient having been placed <em>completely</em> under the
influence of chloroform, the clitoris is freely excised
either by scissors or knife—I always prefer the scissors.
The wound is then firmly plugged with graduated
compresses of lint, and a pad, well secured by a T
bandage.</p>

<p class='c008'>A grain of opium is introduced per rectum, the
patient placed in bed, and most carefully watched by
a nurse, to prevent hæmorrhage by any disturbance
of the dressing. The neglect of this precaution will
be frequently followed by alarming hæmorrhage, and
consequent injurious results.</p>

<p class='c008'>The diet must be unstimulating, and consist of milk,
farinaceous food, fish, and occasionally chicken; all
alcoholic or fermented liquors being strictly prohibited.
The strictest quiet must be enjoined, and the attention
of relatives, if possible, avoided, so that the moral
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>influence of medical attendant and nurse may be uninterruptedly
maintained.</p>

<p class='c008'>A month is generally required for perfect healing of
the wound, at the end of which time it is difficult for
the uninformed, or non-medical, to discover any trace
of an operation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rapid improvement of the patient immediately
after removal of the source of irritation is most
marked; first in the countenance, and soon afterwards
by improved digestion and other evidences of
healthy assimilation.</p>

<p class='c008'>It cannot be too often repeated, that this improvement
can only be made permanent, in many cases,
by careful watching and moral training, on the part of
both patient and friends.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the large majority of cases, I have administered
no medicines, trusting entirely to recovery, after the
removal of the source of irritation. Sometimes, however,
we may be materially aided by the use of such
medicines as the bromides of potassium and ammonium,
belladonna, &amp;c.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <span class='large'>HYSTERIA, WITH CASES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>It may, perhaps, be necessary before relating
cases which I have treated, suffering from
hysteria, to state briefly what I understand by this
term. The word Hysteria was doubtless originally
used in the belief that it depended on excessive
reflex action of the nerves of the uterus and ovaries,
when these organs were excited by disease or other
causes; but this view is a very limited one, for, as
Dr. Handfield Jones says, “it does not appear that
females suffering with irritable uterus are more
hysterical, often not so much so, as those who have
no such disorder.” There is, however, as I have
already mentioned, in almost all hysterical patients,
an exacerbation at the menstrual periods.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Copland’s opinion, that “increased reflex
excitability of the nerves of the female generative
organs is one principal causative condition of hysterical
affections,” appears to me the correct one. Romberg
also says, “from the time when hysteria has taken
root, the reflex action preponderates throughout the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>organism, and renders the individual more dependent
upon external stimuli.”</p>

<p class='c008'>I have alluded in the last chapter to those patients
who have no desire to get well. Such I am not considering;
and although I believe that all the complaints
of an hysterical patient are more or less exaggerated,
my experience differs from that of Dr. Handfield
Jones, who believes that such patients are not “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonâ
fide</span></i> anxious to get well.” In his view he is supported
by Dr. Prout, who considers that “the whole energies
of the patient’s mind are bent on deception;”
and by Dr. Watson, who says that “the deceptive
appearances displayed in the bodily functions and
feelings find their counterpart in the mental.” I am
confident that I have met with many instances in
which the nerve power has become so weakened that
the patient, without having organic disease, really
feels all the symptoms she describes, and is only too
anxious to be cured. The cases I shall now narrate
are a few of a large number that have come under
my care, and I am not without hope that their relation
may show that hysteria, instead of being a term
of reproach, does truly represent a curable disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following was the first case that came under
my notice, after I had satisfied myself of the correctness
of my views on the subject:—</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>
  <h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Case I. Hysteria—Five Years’ Illness—Operation—Cure in Two Months.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>D. E., æt. 26, single; admitted into the London Surgical Home
Oct. 12, 1859.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—She had been a dressmaker in Yorkshire to all the
best families around, but for the last five years had been so ill as
to render her unable to do any work, and had been entirely supported
by her former customers. When in that neighbourhood, on
a professional visit to a lady, I was requested to see, amongst
others, this poor <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ci-devant</span></i> dressmaker. Her physiognomy at once
told me the nature of the case; she was much attenuated, having for a
longtime been unable to retain any food, always being sick, with great
pain, immediately after meals. She had constant acid eructations;
was so weak as to be at times unable to cross the room; complained
of a burning, aching pain, with great weakness at the lower part of
the back. Her catamenia were irregular, with much leucorrhœa;
bowels generally costive. She was very melancholy, and expressed
a most earnest desire to be cured. I advised her admission to the
“Home,” and on October 15, I divided the clitoris subcutaneously.
This being my first operation, I did not know the consequences of
performing the operation in this manner. For two days the
hæmorrhage was profuse and uncontrollable. Sleep was procured
by opiates. I ordered ℥ij of olive oil to be rubbed into her chest
every night, with a view to nutrition of her attenuated frame. A
moderately generous diet was given, <em>but no stimulants</em>. She was
quite well in two months, and has never since had a day’s illness.
She resumed her occupation as a dressmaker, and recovered nearly
all her former customers. 1865.—I have heard almost yearly of
this patient, and lately had a letter from the lady to whom I previously
referred, saying that my patient is perfectly well and in
robust health.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>
  <h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Case II. Two Years’ Illness—Operation—Cures.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>P. F., æt. 21, single; admitted into the London Surgical Home
Jan. 7, 1861.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—Attributes her illness to having strained herself two
years ago, when lifting a heavy saucepan from the fire. Has ever
since that time suffered great pain in the back and side, much worse
when she walks, but tolerably easy in the prone position. Catamenia
very irregular, both as to time and quantity. Great pain in
defecation. Bowels very constipated. Has been eleven weeks in
a metropolitan general hospital, and thirteen weeks in a special
hospital for women, from both of which she was discharged as
having nothing the matter, because she had no evident disease.
She had, however, been treated for uterine disease.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>On examination</em>, the uterus was found to be quite healthy; there
was, however, evidence of excitation of the pudic nerve.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jan. 10. The clitoris completely excised.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jan. 16. Is much better.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jan. 31. Discharged from the Home, cured. Is quite well
in her health, having lost all aches and pains, and being able to
defecate without the slightest uneasiness.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Case III. Hysteria—Thirteen Years’ Illness—Sterility—Operation—Cure, and subsequently Three Pregnancies.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>S. S., æt. 33, married; admitted into the London Surgical Home
February 23, 1861.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—Although married several years, has had no children.
About a year ago suffered from pain in the right side, which, however,
being treated was cured. In April last the pain returned in the
back, and at short intervals has recurred. At times the pain is so
severe that she is unable to walk. Has for thirteen years suffered
from leucorrhœa, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">globus hystericus</span>, &amp;c.; and has always had distaste
for marital intercourse.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span><em>Examination</em> confirming me in the diagnosis I had formed of
this case, I, on February 28, operated in the usual manner. Her
recovery was retarded by an attack of jaundice, but in May she
was discharged cured.</p>

<p class='c011'>In July, 1862, this patient was seen quite well and ruddy, and
had long lost all her old symptoms. She had been once pregnant,
but miscarried at three months.</p>

<p class='c011'>In July, 1865, she came to town with her youngest child. She
was quite well, and had never been ill since the operation.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Remarks.</em>—This was the first case of this nature under my care,
in which the patient, formerly sterile, became pregnant after removal
of the cause of her illness.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Case IV. Hysteria, with Sleeplessness—Six Years’ Illness—Operation—Cure.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>H. R., æt. 55, single; admitted into the London Surgical Home
Nov. 18, 1861.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—For six years has suffered from a feeling of fulness,
weight, and heat at the lower part of abdomen, with pain in the back,
and “bearing down.” At this time her menses had just ceased.
Has not slept well for three or four years. Wakes every hour. Is
always restless and fidgety. Frequent desire to micturate, with
pain on doing so, and often desire without power to void it. Bowels
costive; digestion indifferent.</p>

<p class='c011'>She is a nervous, restless woman, with glistening and constantly
wandering eye—pupils dilated. Has suffered from peripheral irritation
for many years.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nov. 21, 1861. Usual operation performed. A week later, slept
well for four hours, the first time for many years.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dec. 1. Has lost the irritability of the bladder, and passes water
every four hours only; lost also the bearing-down pain; restless
excitement gone.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dec. 7. Eats and sleeps well; is cheerful and grateful; leaves
the Home cured, having been in only three weeks.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1863 was perfectly well.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. L., æt. 55; admitted into the London Surgical Home Dec. 9,
1861.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—Is a widow. Has for many years suffered from all the
inconveniences of a fissure of the rectum, combined with bad
digestion, undue nervous excitability, and sleepless nights. Is
very anxious to be cured. It being thought that all these symptoms
might be due to a painful fissure of the rectum, the ordinary
operation for this affection was performed on December 12. The
bowels were opened in a few days without pain, and the fissure was
healing well. Being, however, still sleepless, excitable, and irritable,
questions were asked which showed that a further operation for
removal of another source of irritation was advisable; therefore, on
December 24, I performed my usual operation. The next night she
slept well. She became quiet and cheerful, and on January 6,
1862, she was discharged quite well.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Remarks.</em>—This case is very interesting, as it shows that there
may exist at the same time more than one irritation exerting inhibitory
influence.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Case VI. Hysteria, with Epileptiform Attacks in Childhood—Various Ailments for Thirteen Years—Operation—No Benefit.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>H. D., æt. 23 single; admitted into the London Surgical Home
April, 1862.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—When very young, until ten years of age, had frequent
fits. Improved in health till she was fourteen years of age, when
she began to suffer from abdominal enlargement. First menstruated
at nineteen. Is constantly sick after meals. Has been in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>nearly every hospital in London. The patient is very hysterical,
and is always <em>talking</em> religion.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>On examination</em> the abdomen was found very tympanitic. Under
chloroform this state quite subsided. Walls of abdomen fat and
muscular. Body generally well nourished. Evidence of continual
irritation of the pudic nerve.</p>

<p class='c011'>April 3. Operation as usual.</p>

<p class='c011'>For some time after the operation this patient was much better
of the sickness, and great interest was manifested by several
visitors in her case; she never, however, received permanent
benefit, being a regular impostor, and discovered on several occasions
tying handkerchiefs, &amp;c., tightly round her waist to make her
abdomen swell. She was discharged as incurable.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Remarks.</em>—This case I have inserted as a warning. It is no fault
of the operation if it fail in such cases.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Case VII. Hysteria—Several Years’ Illness—Operation—Cure.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>Miss M., æt. 42; admitted into the London Surgical Home April
13, 1862.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—Has felt ailing for many years, but for the last two
has suffered pain in the uterine region, and, on pressure, over the
ovaries. This pain is accompanied by bearing down, and a sense
of distension. Suffers from considerable leucorrhœa. Menstruation
regular, and during the period the pain is absent. Bowels
regular. Sleep disturbed. Feels depressed, and is inclined to
melancholia.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>On examination</em> there was no congestion of uterus or enlargement
of ovaries, but there was evidence of peripheral irritation of
the pudic nerve.</p>

<p class='c011'>April 17. Usual operation performed.</p>

<p class='c011'>She rapidly improved; sleep and cheerfulness returned, and all
pain left her. She expressed herself as not having been so well
for many years.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>May 13. Left the Home, having gained flesh and strength,
and being quite cured of all her bad symptoms.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Remarks.</em>—Interest attaches to this case, as instead of exacerbation,
there was diminution of the symptoms during menstruation.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Case VIII. Hysteria—Many Years’ Illness—Phantom Tumour—Operation—Cure.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>A. B., æt. 24; admitted into the London Surgical Home 16th
July, 1862.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—Is a single woman, and procures a living by dressmaking.
When younger, was a nurse-maid. Catamenia commenced
before she was thirteen, but she was not regular until she was
nineteen, since which the function has proceeded normally both in
time and quantity. Has for many years been ailing, and always
had something the matter. Has suffered from intense irritation in
the genital region, especially in the bladder, and she has constant
pain in the back. For two years has been treated at a dispensary
for an abdominal tumour; during this period she has taken much
medicine, but without benefit.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>On examination</em> the abdomen was found increased in size and
universally tympanitic. Under the influence of chloroform the
swelling entirely subsided.</p>

<p class='c011'>July 17. Usual operation performed under the influence of
chloroform.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sept. 2. She was discharged quite cured, all her hysterical
symptoms having left her, and the tumour never having been seen
since the day of operation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. O. came under my care in 1862. She had been ill ever
since marriage, five years previously; having distaste for the
society of her husband, always laid upon the sofa, and under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>medical treatment. Evidence of peripheral excitement being
manifest, I performed my usual operation. She rapidly lost all
the hysterical symptoms which had previously existed; and in
about a year came up to town to consult me concerning a tumour,
which greatly frightened her, as she feared it was ovarian. I discovered
that she was six months pregnant. She was delivered at
full time of a healthy child. In 1865 she again called on me to
show herself, not only in robust health, but pregnant for the
second time.</p>

<p class='c013'>C. M. A., æt. 28, single; admitted into the London Surgical
Home June 22, 1863.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—Since the age of 19 has been more or less subject to
uterine flooding; for the first three years lost blood every day.
Has been five times in a metropolitan hospital; always better
while there, but as bad as ever as soon as she left. The bleeding
is much worse at each menstrual period. She passes large coagula;
has constant pain in the back, headache, and palpitation of the
heart, and cannot sleep; is dreadfully pale and anæmic.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Examination</em> showed great irritation over right ovary, and there
was evidence of long-continued peripheral irritation.</p>

<p class='c011'>July 2. Usual operation.</p>

<p class='c011'>July 7. Menstruation came on in a moderate flow.</p>

<p class='c011'>July 10. Menstruation ceased; is much better, and there is
sign of returning colour in the face.</p>

<p class='c011'>July 31. Has improved considerably, and had no return of
the bleeding. To be discharged cured.</p>

<p class='c013'>Emma K., æt. 22, single; admitted September 16, 1863, into
the London Surgical Home.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—Commenced menstruating at 15 years of age, but
owing to the use of cold water during a period, the secretion was
arrested for six months; the function was then restored, and has
ever since continued normal. At 16 she suffered from piles, which
occasioned very much irritation and pain after each evacuation,
aggravated by constipation and by walking. Though regular as
to time, there is always excessive catamenial flow, and it lasts for
eight days. Has been under long and varied medical treatment,
without benefit.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Examination</em> showed peripheral irritation, as evinced by the
abnormal condition of the external genitals.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sept. 17, 1863. The usual operation performed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Oct. 1. Progressing most favourably.</p>

<p class='c011'>Oct. 22. Leaves quite cured.</p>

<p class='c011'>1866. This lady married, and was delivered August, 1865, of
a living child. She is still quite well.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will have been observed that one very prominent
symptom in many of the foregoing cases is sleeplessness,
or perhaps more properly, frequent wakefulness
at nights, and constant restless movements in the
day. These are the cases which, if left to go on,
are very liable to terminate in insanity. The three
following are instances in which the hysteria was
verging on this state, and as they can hardly be
classed under the head of insanity, I prefer narrating
them here.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>In December, 1861, a single lady consulted me, giving the following
history of her illness:—</p>

<p class='c011'>Has not been well for seven or eight years; has felt languid, and
not so lively as formerly. For the last two years has menstruated
every three weeks, and the flow has lasted four or five days. There
is considerable white discharge from the vagina after each period,
lasting for a week. Great irritation about vulva, perinæum, and
anus before and during each menstrual period. For the last five
or six years had had occasional irresistible and unaccountable fits
of depression; thinks that it is her mind—if her mind were as
strong as her body she would be pretty well: her memory is good,
but mind weak. Has suffered from great pain at lower part of the
back; says she cannot rise from a chair without great difficulty,
on account of a feeling of stiffness in hips and trembling of the
legs (this is probably owing to a swelling of the hip-joint, as all
the joints of her fingers and ankles are swollen). Says she can sit
quietly to crochet or needlework, but cannot sit quietly to think,
or compose her mind to write a letter: has not written a letter
properly for three years. Has been subject to attacks of melancholy
and weeping, without any tangible cause, but which she
cannot resist. Suffers from want of sleep, and at night frequently
lies awake four or five hours together. Appetite good; bowels
costive.</p>

<p class='c011'>In appearance is fresh-coloured and plump, but she says she is
thinner than formerly; dark eyes; large dilated pupils.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>On examination</em> there was evidence of great irritation about the
vulva, and constriction of the anus, with a very small fissure.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dec. 21. I divided the fissure, and performed my usual
operation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dec. 31. Very much improved; swelling of the joints much
less.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>Jan. 1. She sat up, and feels much better. Her spirits are
improved; has no pain in the joints; sleeps well. In another
month she returned home quite well, and has continued so to the
present time.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Case XIII. Extreme Hysteria, verging on Insanity—Five Years’ Illness—Operation—Cure.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. ——, æt. 32, married; admitted into the London Surgical
Home August 5, 1862.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—Has been married twelve years, but has had no children
nor miscarriages. Has always enjoyed pretty good health until
about five years ago, when she began to suffer from leucorrhœa
and great pain during menstruation. Catamenia regular in time
and quantity. Her bladder is so irritable that sometimes she has
to pass her water every half-hour; the urine sometimes very much
loaded. Suffers from headache and giddiness in the morning. Says
that for the last three years the act of coition has been accomplished
without the least pleasure, but with pain. Bowels are
opened regularly and without pain.</p>

<p class='c011'>August 7. Having diagnosed the cause of the disease, the
usual operation was performed.</p>

<p class='c011'>August 9. A severe attack of erysipelas came on, and she
was very ill for some days, but she made a good recovery.</p>

<p class='c011'>A few days after the operation this patient was observed to be
occasionally very violent and unmanageable, and to have at these
times a wild maniacal look. On questioning her husband, it
appeared that for several years she had been subject to fits of violent
excitement, especially during the menstrual period, and that at such
times “she would fly at him and rend his skin, like a tigress.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This patient made a good recovery; she remained quite well, and
became in every respect a good wife.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. R., æt. 42; admitted into the London Surgical Home Aug. 5,
1862.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—Has been married, but has been a widow for twelve
years. Is companion to a lady. Never had any family. Has been
ailing for some years, but has not suffered severely until the last
six months. Suffers most from pain in the lower part of the abdomen,
and from constant burning and irritation about the vulva.
During the last few months has become very nervous and fidgety;
never can remain quiet, and says that lately she “has had a sort of
lost feeling, particularly when writing; being unable to compose her
thoughts, or concentrate her mental energies.” Has suffered from
considerable irritability of the bladder; and her urine is often
full of thick deposit. Catamenia regular in time and quantity.
Cannot sleep.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>On examination</em>, is a very nervous woman, her eyes restless and
never quiet; constant twitchings of the limbs, and occasionally an
appearance almost of insanity about her expression. There is every
evidence of a long-continued inhibitory influence.</p>

<p class='c011'>August 7. The usual operation performed.</p>

<p class='c011'>August 8. Feels very comfortable. Slept better last night
than for some years.</p>

<p class='c011'>August 9. Is improving wonderfully: the expression of countenance
completely changed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sept. 9. Left quite well. Has got fat, and has now a cheerful
face and manner. Says she feels a different being, and is quite
astonished at her own improvement. Has lost all her nervous
twitchings and other uncomfortable symptoms, and has now a comfortable
night’s rest.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <span class='large'>SPINAL IRRITATION, WITH CASES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>There are perhaps few terms so difficult to define
as spinal irritation, for the gradations from
hysteria to this state are extremely easy; and, indeed,
it will have been seen that in the foregoing chapter
most of the patients complained of pain in the spine,
and that there was more or less functional disturbance
in all of them. The term is also used so freely and
vaguely that great caution is necessary in attempting
to explain its meaning. Dr. Handfield Jones’s term,
“Spinal Paresis,” seems to me an excellent one; by it
he means “a state in which, without demonstrable
organic change, there is greater or less enfeeblement
of the functional power” of the spinal cord. The
sensory or motor power may be affected, but rarely
both together.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cause of spinal irritation, or paresis, may be
defined in one word—“debility;” this debility always,
or almost always, being due to inhibitory irritation.</p>

<p class='c008'>This state of things may give rise to wide and varied
disorders, all the symptoms of which are asthenic in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>their character, and all of which are marked by
extreme nervous prostration.</p>

<p class='c008'>Without doubt,—for all authors agree on this point,
one of the most prominent causes is peripheral irritation
of the pudic nerve, producing undue exhaustion.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is difficult to say how this is produced, but most
probably it is that, “owing to the intimate commissural
connections between the lumbar enlargement of the
cord, where the pudic nerves are implanted (they themselves
being small and remote in their origin from the
brain); and the superior and nobler nervous centres,
the intense excitation of even a small and remote
centre is communicated to the others, which, as this
subsides, fall as much below, as they have previously
been stimulated above par. The depression is proportional
to the previous excitement.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The cases I shall have to relate which may fairly be
called cases of spinal irritation are few in number, for
the reason I have stated, that they are but a continuation
of hysteria,<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c010'><sup>[3]</sup></a> and, indeed, but a state of things of
which epileptiform and epileptic fits are the direct
sequence.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. <em>Vide</em> Cases in previous chapter.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It is, however, well to draw attention to the fact
that it is in cases of spinal irritation that we observe
functional derangements, which are very likely to pass
into actual organic diseases; and it is in this class of
cases, which are essentially of a chronic character,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>that very long and persistent perseverance must be
pursued. I would, therefore, advise all who meet with
them to warn their patients beforehand that they must
not be weary and faint-hearted if recovery do not come
as soon as hoped for.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Case XV. Spinal Irritation, and supposed Uterine Displacement—Six Years’ Illness—Operation—Cure.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>In 1860, I was requested to see a young lady, æt. 20, of whom I
had the following history:—For six years she had been confined to a
spinal couch, and had also been supposed to suffer from retroversion
of the uterus. She had worn a spinal apparatus, attached to which
was a steel spring, pressing on sacrum and pubis, and intended “to
support the perinæum, and keep the uterus in position.” Had been
treated with caustics and other therapeutic agents for uterine
disease. I found the uterus normal in position and healthy in
appearance; but on further questioning and examination, I diagnosed
peripheral irritation of the pudic nerve. My opinion was
strongly contested, as I was told that the young lady was very religious;
but, as I explained, her illness was to be attributed solely to
a physical condition, and was not at all necessarily immoral; I was
then met with the objection that, in the event of marriage my
operation might interfere with marital happiness and prevent procreation.
I explained how, physiologically, these objections were
untenable, but was then unable to adduce actual cases in contradiction
of them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ultimately I performed my operation in the usual manner. For
want of proper attention on the part of the nurse, the dressing was
three times displaced; but, nevertheless, at the end of a month this
lady was well enough to walk three miles.</p>

<p class='c011'>Up to this date she has remained quite well.</p>

<p class='c013'>D. A., æt. 23; admitted into the London Surgical Home Aug. 4,
1863.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—Has never been very strong; but five years ago had
an attack of gastric fever. Since then has suffered constantly from
great pain during the menstrual period. Occasionally loses a great
deal, and passes large clots of blood. During this time has suffered
almost constantly from leucorrhœa. Suffers severely from pain over
region of left ovary and in the spine. Is hardly ever free from
headaches. Is very restless; never sleeps well; frequently faints;
and has little or no appetite. All her ills are exaggerated at the
menstrual epoch.</p>

<p class='c011'>August 7. Usual operation performed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sept. 1. Is menstruating without pain.</p>

<p class='c013'>M. B., æt. 30, single; admitted into the London Surgical Home
Nov. 15, 1861.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—Five years ago first began to suffer pain in the right
leg, which was ascribed to sciatica. Fourteen months since this
pain became so bad that she could not walk, and she lost all use of
her right leg, at the same time felt great weakness and pain in the
back, preventing her sitting. For eight months has been confined
to a “spinal couch.” Is a spare anæmic woman; dark hair and
eyes; dilated pupils; very restless and nervous in her movements,
and of a very irritable temper. Has suffered from peripheral irritation
since an early age.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Nov. 26, 1861. Usual operation performed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dec. 27. She has gradually improved in health and temper
since the operation, and is now quite able to walk about her room
without help.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was a long time before her nerve tone was thoroughly restored,
but she ultimately got quite strong and continues well.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Case XVIII. Hysteria and Spinal Irritation Twelve Years—Fissure of Rectum, recent Duration—Operation—Cure.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>R. C. R., æt. 35 years, single; admitted into the London Surgical
Home April 15, 1861.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—Has been suffering for nearly twelve years, at intervals
of from six months to six weeks, with pain in the womb and right
side, sudden spasms of the limbs, coming on at frequent and irregular
intervals. Great pain down the spine and lower part of the back and
loins. Has often attacks of severe sickness. Is usually costive.
Has lately suffered great pain in defecation. Catamenia regular.
Great want of sleep and appetite. Says she is always low-spirited,
moping, and listless. Has had much medical treatment.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>On examination</em> there was found evidence of peripheral excitement
of the pudic nerve, and there also existed a fissure of the
rectum.</p>

<p class='c011'>April 18. The usual operation performed, and the fissure of
the rectum incised.</p>

<p class='c011'>After this time defecation was performed without pain. Sleep,
appetite, and cheerful spirits returned. She had no more spasmodic
twitchings, but she still complained of intense pain in the back on
sitting and walking. She was discharged in June much relieved,
but not well.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nov. 9 1861. I received a letter from this lady, stating that
she now suffered no pain and was perfectly well. She was stout,
and better in every respect than she had been for the last twelve
years.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Case XIX. Menorrhagia—Mental Delusion—Two Years’ Illness—Operation—Cure—Subsequent Marriage and Progeny.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>A young lady, æt. 20, came under my care in 1863, having for
two years past suffered from almost constant menorrhagia, during
which time she had suffered great irritability of temper, been disobedient
to her mother’s wishes, and had sleepless nights, restless
desire for society, and was constantly seeking admiration; all these
symptoms culminating in a monomania that every gentleman she
admired was in love with her, and she insisted on always sending
her <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte de visite</span></i> to her favoured one for the time being. In her
quieter moments she would spend much time in serious reading.
On being consulted, I quickly discovered that all these symptoms
arose from peripheral excitement, and that there existed no organic
disease to cause the menorrhagia. The usual plan of treatment
was followed with the most rapid and marked success. She went
the full interval between the ensuing menstrual periods, and the
secretion was normal in quantity. All her delusions disappeared,
and after three or four months of careful watching, with change of
air, she was perfectly well in every respect. A year afterwards she
married, and ten months later gave birth to a healthy son. She is
now again pregnant.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Case XX. Spinal Irritation, giving rise to Menorrhagia and Amaurosis—Operation—Cure.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>A single lady, æt. 35, came under my care in 1863. Had been out
of health for some years, suffering from continuous menorrhagia,
seldom being free more than ten days or a fortnight in the month.
Was thin and spare in appearance; often complaining of headache,
especially over the brow and orbits; and, in fact, nearly a confirmed
invalid. Latterly she had become almost blind from
amaurosis; she could only read the largest type, and not at all by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>candle-light. Had come to London from the country, and placed
herself under the care of one of the most eminent ophthalmic
surgeons, who had treated her for three months without the slightest
benefit. When I saw her I immediately discovered that long-continued
peripheral excitement had caused all her disorders. Quickly
after the operation, menstruation became regular; in ten days she
was able to read in bed; in a month she was quite well. I frequently
hear of her now, as in robust health.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Remarks.</em>—Beyond a grain of opium after the operation, this
patient never had any medicine. I have had other cases exactly
similar, with like result.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Case XXI. Spinal Irritation—Loss of Power in Lower Extremities—Operation—Rapid Improvement.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>Last year I was requested to see a lady, æt. 46, who had been
married to a second husband seventeen years without issue, but
had two children by her first marriage. Had not menstruated for
two years. Has been in ill health for many years, and undergone
a variety of medical treatment without benefit. In May, 1863,
first began to lose the power of her legs, and to suffer from attacks
of pain in the back, shooting up to the spine. She was at this
time in Paris, where she consulted several men of eminence, and
was treated for uterine disease, but still without benefit. She
returned to London in June, 1863, and placed herself under the
care of her usual medical attendant. Relief, after some time, not
being afforded, she consulted several eminent surgeons in the metropolis.
She was told that she had paralysis of the lower extremities,
and that nothing could be done with a hope of effecting
cure. From January, 1865, she was for six months under the care
of an eminent general practitioner, who exhausted the resources
of his art, but in vain. She was, in fact, “given up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As a last resource, I was applied to. I saw her in August at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>her own house. Her countenance had a worn and haggard expression;
her body was emaciated; skin harsh, dry, and scaly; the
lower extremities hung as if paralyzed, but sensibility and voluntary
motion—the latter, however, very weak—were not entirely absent.
She complained of severe spasmodic attacks of agonizing pain
shooting up the spine, like tetanic shocks. Her appetite was very
defective, digestion was impaired, the bowels disordered, and sleep
was hardly ever procured. There was also partial ptosis of the left
upper eyelid. On examination, I found a deep and acutely painful
fissure, with large piles and loose skin around the anus, and all
the well-marked signs of peripheral irritation of the clitoris.</p>

<p class='c011'>August, 1865. I operated, Dr. Kidd administering chloroform.
I divided the fissure, tied the piles with three ligatures, cut
off the loose skin around the anus, and removed the clitoris and
elongated labia in my usual manner.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was gratifying to observe the early relief of her more severe
symptoms; by the third day the spasmodic attacks ceased, little
or no pain was complained of, and the improvement of the digestive
system was most marked, the patient enjoying chops, game, &amp;c.,
within ten days, and no longer “a martyr to flatulence and
dyspepsia.” The digestion was, however, easily deranged, and
great care was necessary. At the end of seven weeks, having
already on several occasions been driven out in a carriage, she was
removed to the country, where she remained for three weeks. It
may be here stated that the patient suffered much from the very
sultry weather of September, and that improvement was much
more rapid when colder weather set in. On her return, she was
able to stand for a few minutes with her hands resting on the
shoulders of another. Remaining in town for some weeks, she
again left for the sea-side, where she stayed about three weeks,
and returned to town in the beginning of this year. Her condition
is now as follows:—</p>

<p class='c011'>She looks remarkably well in the face, which has entirely lost its
expression of suffering. She is free from pain. Sensibility in the
lower extremities is perfect; their muscular power is greatly improved.
She can raise herself from a chair so as to rest on her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>hands and feet, and is able to walk across her room, holding the
hands of her maid, who retreats before her. She sleeps well every
night, and her digestion is in very fair order. She is now able to
sit up to all her meals, and to sit in an upright chair for hours
together, whereas formerly she was constantly in the recumbent
position.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <span class='large'>EPILEPTOID CONVULSIONS, OR HYSTERICAL EPILEPSY, WITH CASES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>In the chapter on hysteria, cases have been recorded
of frequent faintings, without spasms, and of spasmodic
twitchings of limbs without fainting, <em>i.e.</em> without
loss of consciousness. We now come to cases more
marked and chronic, and having many of the characters
of epilepsy. They may be brought to us by the friends
of the patient as genuine epileptics. The diagnosis is
in some cases difficult, but for the most part easy.
Dr. Russell Reynolds<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c010'><sup>[4]</sup></a> has summed up the distinctive
features so ably that I cannot do better than quote his
final remarks on this subject:—</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. “Epilepsy: its Symptoms, Treatment, and Relation to other
Chronic Convulsive Diseases.” By J. Russell Reynolds, M.D.
London: Churchill, 1861.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“The paroxysm resembles epilepsy, and sometimes
closely, but it differs in essential particulars. The
difference is not one only of degree, neither is it to
be determined by the relation of hysterical convulsion
to pain, nor solely by the nature of the spasm. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>diagnosis is to be based upon a combination of features.
The paroxysms follow hysteric prodromata.<a id='t42'></a> At their
onset there is constriction of the throat and epigastrium;
there are plaintive cries, sobbings, or
laughings, which reappear at the close; <em>sensibility, perception,
and volition are rarely, if ever, completely lost</em>;
the face undergoes little change; there is a twinkling
movement of the eyelids; there is no marked dilatation
of the pupil; <em>there is rarely foaming or bitten
tongue</em>; the attacks are of long duration; respiratory
movements are disorderly, but there are no evidences
of marked asphyxia; the pulse is small; there is no
stupor, but only general exhaustion after the attack;
and although the paroxysms may recur for many years,
and be followed by a peculiar kind of mania, they are
rarely followed by dementia.”</p>

<p class='c008'>I fully agree with Dr. Reynolds that what are called
the “diagnostic signs of hysteria,” as frequent micturition
of clear pale urine, tympanitis, nausea, &amp;c.,
have no value in aiding our inquiry as to the nature of
these fits: they may be witnessed, and with as great
frequency, after epileptic seizures.</p>

<p class='c008'>One practical point exists; namely, that in hysterical
epilepsy the patient seldom, I believe never, in falling
hurts herself, whereas true epileptics frequently suffer
considerable bodily injuries.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>G. M., single; admitted into the London Surgical Home December
18, 1860.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—For the last nine years has suffered greatly and regularly
during the menstrual periods. Has been much worse for the
last three years, during which time has, at each menstrual period,
been frequently taken in a fit, dropping down suddenly and fainting
right off; this state lasting for two or three hours. Being in service,
this has caused her much trouble, as none of her employers would
keep her. For the last six months has suffered severe pain over
right ovary, increased by exercise or pressure, and at the menstrual
period. Believing that the dysmenorrhœa and fits both arose from
the same cause, on January 3, clitoris was cut down to the base.
After this operation she never had a fit, and all untoward symptoms
left her except the dysmenorrhœa; she was therefore re-admitted
May 27, 1861, and there being some narrowing of the cervix, it was
incised with the hysterotome. June 21, catamenia came on without
pain, and continued to do so regularly. In July she was well
enough to return to service.</p>

<p class='c011'>April, 1865. Her mother called at my house to say that this
patient had been married some months, and was shortly expecting
her confinement. She had remained quite well since the operation.</p>

Home Nov. 6, 1863.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—Says she had congestion of the brain fifteen years ago;
since that period cannot remember being well, but from the age of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>fifteen has been of delicate health. Has suffered from fits for the
last fourteen or fifteen years; is never long free from them. During
an attack she is not entirely unconscious, but possesses no power to
control them nor to speak. Has pain at lower part of spine of a
gnawing character. She is a miserable, nervous creature, with
pinched features and a wandering restless expression of the eye.
There is evidence of injurious peripheral irritation since a very
early age.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nov. 12. Operation as usual under chloroform.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nov. 19. Is wonderfully better. The expression of her face is
much happier, and the face itself has filled out considerably. No

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—Has been delicate from childhood. For some months
has suffered from a peculiar dragging pain in the lower part of the
abdomen. Menstruates regularly. Suffers from “burning” and
irritability of bladder. Has constant and severe headache. Has
for a long time suffered from “epileptic fits” (on careful observation
they were found not to be genuine epileptic), occurring twice
or thrice a week. Is a melancholy object, with “woe-begone” expression;
listless and indifferent to conversation and surrounding
objects; when spoken to, does not answer rationally, and frequently
only in monosyllables. Is very reserved and taciturn.</p>

<p class='c011'>Feb. 4. Patient being under chloroform, the clitoris was excised.</p>

<p class='c011'>Feb. 13. Progressing favourably; much improved in appearance;
more cheerful; converses freely and rationally; expresses
herself as grateful for her restoration to health.</p>

<p class='c013'>R. D., æt. 31; admitted into the London Surgical Home Feb. 17,
1864.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—Married eight years, with one child. Her husband is
in the navy, and often absent from home. Previous to her marriage
had a severe illness, in which she was delirious, and again in 1860,
when she lost her reason for six weeks. “Was very feverish and
could retain no food on the stomach.” The menstrual periods are
most irregular, six or eight months sometimes elapsing between
each appearance. Has not menstruated since June last. Has great
difficulty in passing her urine. For many years has suffered from
fits of an epileptiform character, having, in an attack, convulsions
and rigidity, but never hurting herself in falling, foaming at the
mouth, nor biting her tongue.</p>

<p class='c011'>Feb. 18. Clitoris excised.</p>

<p class='c011'>Feb. 24. Much improved, free from pain or difficulty in micturition.

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—Married sixteen years, but her husband has been
abroad for the past seven years. Had inflammation of the womb
four years ago, and since that time has continually suffered from
bearing-down pains. Frequent desire to micturate. Pain in the
loins and spine, sleepless nights, loss of appetite, and other hysterical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>symptoms. Has slight “epileptic fits” two or three times a week,
more frequently at catamenial periods, which are regular in appearance
and not profuse. Has no premonition of fits; is but partially
conscious; at first struggles, then becomes rather rigid, and on recovery
is always exhausted. Patient is most anxious to be cured
of her attacks, of the cause of which she is fully conscious.</p>

<p class='c011'>April 25. Clitoris excised, under chloroform.</p>

<p class='c011'>April 26. Had a good night, better than for years.</p>

<p class='c011'>April 30. Progressing most favourably. Patient expresses great

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—Has suffered from fits for more than six years, much
more frequently the last six months; having now as many
as four or five during the day—always one or two. The fits vary in
length from one to three hours’ duration. Is conscious during the
attacks, but unable to speak, or in any way to control them. Is
invariably worse during the menstrual periods. Suffers from palpitation
of the heart.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Examination</em> showed a highly inflamed and sensitive condition of
the external generative organs; the patient herself confirmed my
opinion of the cause of her attacks.</p>

<p class='c011'>May 28. Clitoris excised—free hæmorrhage allowed before the

frequently from an aggravated form of hysterical attacks, with
many of the characters of epilepsy, but with only partial insensibility,
and without foaming. Is often sick, and suffers from severe
pain on the right side, with a feeling of pressure on the lower
bowel, with a dragging and bearing-down pain around the loins.
Catamenia regular; more subject to the fits at these periods. No
difficulty in micturition, but a rather frequent desire to micturate;
and urine often loaded.</p>

<p class='c011'>Oct. 20. The clitoris was excised.</p>

<p class='c011'>This patient improved very rapidly; passed upwards of a month
and a menstrual period in the Home without any return of the fits.
All pain over the ovarian regions, and in the loins, &amp;c., left her, and

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <span class='large'>CATALEPSY, WITH CASES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>This affection is extremely rare, and I consider
myself favoured in Having witnessed three well-marked
cases. “It occurs chiefly,” says Dr. Jones,
“in those who have weakly and excitable nervous
systems, feeble health, and ill-governed minds, and
who may be said to possess neither a ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mens sana</span>,’
nor a ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">corpus sanum</span>.’” That this is true there is
not the least doubt, and the first case—one of semi-catalepsy,
or hysterical catalepsy—shows how completely
it is a nervous affection, and depending, at
any rate at the commencement of the disease, very
much on mental control.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are also, it is true, one or two rare cases on
record which were caused by growths on the brain;
and it is sometimes “encountered in tubercular
meningitis, or chronic softening of the brain.”—<em>Reynolds.</em></p>

<p class='c008'>That the cause in the three cases in my own
practice was excitation of the pudic nerve, may, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>think, most fairly be concluded, from the fact that
after the operation neither patient had a single fit.</p>

<p class='c008'>To those who have not seen a patient suffering from
this disease, a few words from Dr. Reynolds may be
necessary:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“The pathognomonic symptom is the persistence
of the limbs in a state of balanced muscular contraction,
so that they retain the position in which they
were placed at the commencement of the attack. The
limbs may be readily moved by the observer, but
they retain the attitudes in which they are left, and
these sometimes for hours, sometimes for days.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perception and volition are lost; the condition
resembles that of ‘brown study;’ the circulation and
respiration are uninterrupted.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Catalepsy seems to rank between tetanus and
epilepsy, and, according to Dr. Jones, depends on the
simultaneous morbid affection of various nerve centres
which, when separately affected, produce but one disorder,—hysteria,
tetanus, or epilepsy.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Case XXIX. Hysterical Catalepsy—Many Years’ Duration—Operation—Relief—Remarks.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Mrs.</span> ——, æt. 33, widow; admitted into the London Surgical
Home May 5, 1865.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—Never had any children, and but one miscarriage.
Menstruation began when she was fourteen, and she was then first
attacked with fits. From the patient’s description, they would
seem to have then been of a cataleptic character; there was no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>loss of consciousness. From the age of 21 up to the present time,
besides slight convulsive attacks in the daytime, she has been
subject to fits at night, occurring irregularly, but averaging one
a week, and always after each menstrual period. They commence
with a strong convulsion, which lasts for a few minutes, and is
succeeded by perfect rigidity of the body and unconsciousness for
half an hour or more. Are preceded by headache during the day.
Catamenia appear regularly, but are scanty. Acknowledges
constant peripheral excitation, and says that, during marriage, she
never had pleasure <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in coitu</span></i>. The dilated pupil, hot skin, moist
palm, and other unmistakable symptoms, plainly pointed to the
cause of her disorder.</p>

<p class='c011'>May 6. Excision of clitoris and the very elongated nymphæ.
Free hæmorrhage was allowed before the wound was dressed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The operation was, in this instance, only successful in diminishing
the frequency and intensity of the fits. The following is the
description given by the house-surgeon of an attack some days
after the operation:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“While conversing with the house-surgeon this morning, she had
a slight convulsive attack, not lasting more than thirty seconds,
and characterized by the following phenomena:—No loss of consciousness,
rigidity of limbs, with tonic contraction of the flexor
muscles, and strong contraction of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">orbicularis palpebrarum</span>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Whenever visited, and frequently when the wound was dressed,
these fits recurred; but towards the end of the month the number
considerably diminished.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was discharged on June 15th, very much improved in health,
and decidedly relieved by the operation.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Case XXX. Hysterical Cataleptic Fits of Long Duration—Operation—Cure.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>H. L., æt. 25, single; admitted into the London Surgical Home
January 27, 1864.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—This patient was sent to me by Dr. Pennefather, of
Tottenham, with the following letter:—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>“Dear Sir,—The girl —— was some time since suffering from
religious monomania; she is of hysterical habit and weak constitution,
ever complaining of abdominal pain or uneasiness.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She also gave the following additional account of herself:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Began to feel unwell about twelve months since. Had a very
bad fever about five months ago, which left her perfectly prostrated.
Always felt weak, and more or less subject to fits. Menstruation
regular and never profuse. Great pain in the back and bearing-down
feeling in the lower part of the body. Complains of great
pain in defecation. Sea-bathing has benefitted her temporarily. Is
incessantly crying without cause or power to prevent herself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The day following admission she had a fit of a cataleptic nature,
and lasting twenty-five minutes. After the fit the patient was left
very prostrated.</p>

<p class='c011'>In addition to symptoms of pudic irritation, there was a small
fissure of the rectum.</p>

<p class='c011'>January 24. Clitoris excised, and fissure divided. There was
considerable secondary hæmorrhage in the excising, which, however,
seemed to have a beneficial effect, as after it the patient expressed
herself as more comfortable, and slept quietly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Feb. 14. Much more cheerful; has had no cataleptic attack or
symptom of hysteria since the operation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Feb. 28. Has improved daily, and leaves the Home this day
cured.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Case XXXI. Cataleptic Fits—Two Years’ Illness—Operation—Cure.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>M. N., æt. 17; admitted into the London Surgical Home September
4, 1861.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—Was perfectly well up to the age of fifteen, when
she went to a boarding-school in the West of England. In the
course of three or four months she became subject to all symptoms
of hysteria, and from that time gradually got worse, having fits, at
first mild in character and of rare occurrence, but gradually mere
severe and frequent, till she became a confirmed cataleptic. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>several months before admission, she had been attacked with as
many as four or five fits a day, and during the whole journey from
the North of England to London she was unconscious and rigidly
cataleptic. She was seen immediately on arrival, and there was
no doubt that it was a genuine case of this disease. So sensitive
was she, that if any one merely touched her bed, or walked across
the room, she would immediately be thrown into the cataleptic
state.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before making any personal examination, Mr. Brown ascertained
both from her mother and herself, that she had long indulged in
self-excitation of the clitoris, having first been taught by a schoolfellow.
The commencement of her illness corresponded exactly
with the origin of its cause; in fact, cause and effect were here
so perfectly manifested, that it hardly wanted anything more than
the history to enable one to form a correct diagnosis. All the other
symptoms attending these cases were, however, well marked.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next day after admission she was operated upon, and from
that date she never had a fit. She remained in the Home for
several weeks. Five weeks after operation, she walked all over
Westminster Abbey, whereas for quite a year and a half before
treatment, she had been incapable of the slightest exertion.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Case XXXII. Cataleptic Fits—Many Years’ Duration—Operation—Cure.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>In 1861 I saw a lady, æt. 50, single—a patient of Dr. Dawson,
of Newcastle-on-Tyne.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had been suffering from cataleptic attacks for several years,
gradually increasing in severity. As in the previous case, the mere
touching or shaking of her bed would induce an attack—indeed,
the simple brushing of her dress by any one passing her when
she walked out of doors, would immediately be followed by a fit.
History and examination plainly confirming me in my opinion as
to the cause of her attacks, the usual treatment was adopted,
and from that time to this she has never had an attack.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>
  <h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Case XXXIII. Cataleptic Fits—Six Years’ Duration—Operation—Cure.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Miss</span> ——, æt. 38, single; admitted into the London Surgical
Home August 10, 1865.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—Was tolerably well until two years and a half ago,
but since that time has suffered more or less from menorrhagia,
with severe pain in back. Has also severe smarting pain in the
bowels, and has frequently lost a considerable quantity of blood
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per anum</span></i>. Has always been subject to hysterical attacks, but
for the last six years has had fits of a much more serious character.
They have increased in severity, duration, and frequency,
and it is on account of them that she seeks relief. Almost immediately
after admission, this patient had a fit, and she was kept a
fortnight under observation, that the nature of the attacks might
be thoroughly investigated.</p>

<p class='c011'>She would have a fit sometimes twice a day; but on an average
about every other day—either early in the morning or late in the
evening. She was most generally attacked when walking about
the room—sometimes when sitting—but she was never observed
to have one when asleep. She would at the commencement of an
attack cease walking, or doing whatever she was employed in; her
face would become very pale and set; the eyelids, at first quivering,
would be fixed; the eyes wide open and looking upwards, the
pupils very dilated. Her mouth would be rigidly shut, and during
the attack it was impossible by any means to open it. Her arms
would fall straight by her side, and be immovable; the hands
unclenched, and fingers extended. If standing, she would be quite
upright, and require no support. If sitting, she would always
stand up when a fit was coming on. If lying, she would be extended
straight on her back. The fit would last for two or three
hours, and on a few occasions for as many as six hours. The experiment
was frequently made of moving her arms when in the cataleptic
state, and on such occasions the limb would remain in the position
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>in which it was placed, till the end of the attack. She was always
perfectly unconscious, and no kind of stimulant was of the slightest
use in restoring her during the paroxysm—time alone was of avail.
The attack was sudden, but the recovery to consciousness was but
gradual; she would appear as if awoke from a deep sleep, and
would be very exhausted, but express no desire for food, wine, or
other stimulants. As soon as she recovered, she would sleep for
many hours, and awake quite well, but still weak.</p>

<p class='c011'>Aug. 24. The clitoris was excised, and a painful fissure of
the rectum divided. She never had a fit after the operation.
Menstruation came on on the 28th, in moderate flow.</p>

<p class='c011'>Oct. 5. This patient has improved wonderfully since operation,
and now looks extremely well. The wound is quite healed. She
takes walks daily, and has had no fits, and is to be discharged
as cured.</p>

<p class='c011'>In November she called at the Home, to say that she was quite
well, and had never had the slightest return of her former illness;
she menstruates regularly and normally.</p>

<p class='c011'>Feb., 1866. She remains well.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Referring my readers for full information on the
pathology and history of epilepsy to Dr. Russell
Reynolds’s exhaustive treatise on the subject already
referred to, I would mention, as shortly as possible, a
few facts which are necessary to be borne in mind, with
especial reference to the class of cases which I am now
considering.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. J. C. Prichard, in writing of diseases of the
nervous system, has well said that “few diseases are
better characterized by them symptoms than epilepsy;
yet in this instance there is such a variety in the phenomena
as renders it difficult to contrive a definition in
a few words which may comprehend every form of the
complaint.”</p>

<p class='c008'>I have said that when convulsions become chronic
they are considered to take on an epileptiform character.
Now, although we know that in a few cases
involuntary spasm may take place in sleep, <em>i.e.</em> with
loss of consciousness, I think we may, for all general
purposes, take as a definition of epilepsy a chronic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>convulsive disease, each convulsive attack being
accompanied with “sudden and complete loss of
consciousness,” this latter symptom being considered
by the late Dr. Todd<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c010'><sup>[5]</sup></a> as “the pathognomonic symptom
of the disease,” but only, as Dr. Reynolds<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c010'><sup>[6]</sup></a> has
shown, “when it occurs as a paroxysmal or occasional
event.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The causes of epilepsy are various—“partly physical,
partly immaterial.” Of the former are injuries and
tumours of the brain or meninges, intestinal worms,
renal and biliary calculi, &amp;c. &amp;c. These are termed
by Dr. Handfield Jones<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c010'><sup>[7]</sup></a> “eccentric causes.” As
“centric causes,” he names “poisoning of the blood
from retention of excrementitious matter; this, by
deranging the nutrition of the nervous tissue, generates
the abnormal excitability, which then manifests
itself without any special irritant. Various causes of
exhaustion, such as hæmorrhage and excessive discharges,
venereal excesses, prolonged want of sleep,
unremitting pain,” &amp;c., are all “centric” causes of
epilepsy.</p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. <em>Op. cit.</em>, p. 209.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Reynolds is right in considering epilepsy an
idiopathic disease, inasmuch as it occurs, without discoverable
organic lesion with which it can be associated,
and because there is no structural lesion of the brain, or
spinal cord, to be found constantly associated with it;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>but when he says that it is idiopathic because, “in many
cases, eccentric irritation cannot be shown to be the
cause of the attacks,” I cannot go with him. Epilepsy is
a name signifying a disease, which may be idiopathic, or
may arise from a variety of causes; but that eccentric
irritation is a powerful and very frequent cause, there
is not the slightest doubt. Dr. Reynolds classes it as
second of six in a table given in his book, physical
conditions being mentioned as first; and finding, in a
hundred cases, that 24·63 have no assignable cause,
and 18·84 are doubtful, he gives 13·04 as due to
eccentric irritation.</p>

<p class='c008'>In considering peripheral irritation of the pudic
nerve as a cause of this disease, we must, I think, consider
mental emotion, which occupies the highest rank
in causes of epilepsy, in conjunction with that second
in the list,—eccentric irritation. I would, therefore,
classify the cause of epilepsy depending on such irritation
as both eccentric and centric. The former,
inasmuch as it produces exhaustion, and, by deranging
the nutrition of the nervous tissue, generates abnormal
excitability; the latter, for that it is a physical excitant
which is not only “a mere provocative of the
paroxysms, the convulsions being supposed to ensue
as the reflex results of irritation, but that it actually
<em>sets up</em> in the nervous centres that state of excitability
which is the essence of the disorder.” Further still,
looking on epilepsy as a direct sequel of hysteria,
when it is produced by excitation of the pudic nerve,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>the patients are, in an eminent degree, predisposed to
the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>Women are also more naturally prone to epilepsy
from mental emotion than men; “Emotional disturbance
being assigned,” says Dr. Reynolds, “as the
cause of their attacks in so many as 36 per cent.,
whereas in the male sex there were only 13 per cent.
who referred their diseases to that cause.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It would be out of place in a work of this nature to
detail at length the symptoms of these attacks.
Whether they are truly epileptic will be seen as the
cases are related. I have been very careful to separate
those which seemed to be of an hysterical or epileptoid
nature; and have had the advantage of being able to
show the greater number of them to many eminent
members of the medical profession, who have witnessed
my practice in the London Surgical Home.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Case XXXIV. Epileptic Fits—Twelve Years’ Duration—Operation—Cure.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>S. F., æt. 41, single; admitted into the London Surgical Home
Dec. 16, 1861.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—Was always ailing, and hysterical for many years.
Catamenia appeared early, and always rather profuse. For the last
twelve years has suffered from epileptic fits; recurring frequently
every week or fortnight, and lately as often as every day. Has
constant headaches; is losing memory and all power of concentrating
her ideas. Has no premonition of seizure; falls down; is
unconscious; has frequently bitten her tongue; and “froths” at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>the mouth. Says she has had several attacks of hæmatemesis. She
was a dressmaker, and had so frequently, on her way to or from
business, fallen in the streets, that she had been carried into almost
every hospital in London, and a large number of open surgeries.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>On examination</em> there was found every indication of irritation
about the vulva, and also a small polypus of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">os uteri</span>, which
latter was large and patulous.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dec. 19. Usual operation of excision; polypus uteri also removed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The recovery of this patient was rapid and uninterrupted. After
the operation, she never had a fit, and hardly a headache. She was
discharged Jan. 20, 1862, perfectly well, and with greatly increased
mental power. When heard of at commencement of 1864, she
remained well, and had had no recurrence of any of her old
symptoms.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Case XXXV. Epileptic Fits—Five Years’ Duration—Preceded by Cataleptic Fits, during the Ten previous Years—Operation—Cure.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>In the beginning of April, 1862, a single lady, æt. 28, came
under my notice, giving the following account of herself.—When
about ten years old had a fit, whilst she was sitting at needlework;
she fell down suddenly as if dead, and remained insensible for two
hours; was very ill for three weeks after the attack. Was quite
well until the age of fourteen, when she began to have them
every three months. When about twenty-two had an interval of
eleven months without a fit, but frequently fainted during that
period. During the time she was in the fits she would be perfectly
unconscious. She was told that her limbs were quite rigid, and
always remained in the exact position in which they were when the
fit commenced. In 1857 the fits changed in their nature—the patient
at first falling down quietly, but subsequently becoming very convulsed,
and trying to hurt herself. The first of this nature lasted two
hours and three-quarters. Has lately had them much oftener, but
not always of the severe form. Has had eight severe fits in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>last two years and a half, besides the milder, which come
sometimes a dozen in a fortnight. Is unconscious, but always
knows when she has had one. Foams at the mouth, but makes no
noise. Has frequently fallen down suddenly in church and other
public places. Has been under many physicians, all of whom have
been of opinion that she is suffering from genuine epilepsy.</p>

<p class='c011'>April 2. Clitoris excised.</p>

<p class='c011'>April 6. Has had no attack, but complains of occasional pain in
the top of her head.</p>

<p class='c011'>She never had an attack after the operation. Returned home in a
month, and shortly afterwards she was thrown out of a pony chaise;
she had no fit, but wrote that, prior to treatment, a very much
slighter accident would have immediately produced one.</p>

<p class='c011'>I heard of this lady later in the year; she was still quite well.
Not having heard since from her, as was agreed when she left me,
I am satisfied that she has had no relapse.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Case XXXVI. Epileptic Fits—Many Years’ Duration—Operation—Cure.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>N. L. M., æt. 21; admitted into the London Surgical Home
May 9, 1863.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—Married four years and had two children; the labours
have been bad, and followed by severe hæmorrhage. Had aborted
at six weeks, a fortnight previous to admission, and had lost a large
quantity of blood. First suffered from epileptic fits at puberty;
had several before marriage, and has had four or five since marriage;
but has never had a fit when pregnant. Not very regular in menstruation,
which is accompanied with severe pain. Has constant
pain on right side of head, in back, loins, &amp;c. Great pain in micturating
and on defecation. She is always totally unconscious during
the fits, and they are followed by extreme prostration. Is of melancholy
aspect, excessively anæmic, and somewhat chlorotic; even
the mucous membranes (of mouth especially) are blanched. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>cause of her fits being diagnosed, the usual <em>operation</em> was performed
May 14.</p>

<p class='c011'>May 18. Progressing excellently.</p>

<p class='c011'>May 20. There was great irritability of the bladder, which,
however, was immediately relieved by an alkaline and henbane
mixture.</p>

<p class='c011'>May 31. Has not had any return of her bad symptoms until
to-day, when, on being removed to a strange ward, she had a fit,
not of violent character, and followed by a heavy drowsiness.</p>

<p class='c011'>June 2. Is quite herself again.</p>

<p class='c011'>July 4. Has left quite well in every respect, and when heard
of many months later remained well.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Remarks.</em>—The fit following on change of this patient from one
ward to another where there were strangers, shows how important
it is for a permanent cure, that visitors and relatives should not be
allowed to excite and agitate a patient suffering from these attacks
after an operation is performed, and when the mind is hardly
restored to its natural balance.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Case XXXVII. Epileptic Fits—Two Years’ Duration—Operation—Cure.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>H. C., æt. 20, single; admitted into the London Surgical Home
Feb. 24, 1864.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—About three years since, first commenced ailing.
Menstruation ceased for four months, when it appeared for two
days. Fifteen months then elapsed before the function was restored.
Epileptic fits have been developed for about two years. The patient
at the commencement of an attack is strongly convulsed, has no
premonition, and is perfectly unconscious. Frequently falls when
walking in the streets. Has often hurt herself in her falls, and also
bitten her tongue. Has the usual symptoms of bearing-down of
the womb, and pain in the loins. No pain in defecation. Bowels
costive. Pain in micturition, and sometimes retention of urine,
occasionally not passing any for two days.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>March 3. Clitoris excised in the usual manner under chloroform.
Was restless and hysterical for the first six days, when she
improved daily, became cheerful, and much more intelligent. She
never had another fit, and on April 13, being quite cured, was, at her
own request, retained in the Home as a servant. She remained
there under observation for six months, during which time she had
not only no return of her former attacks, but progressively improved
in health, and her menstruation became quite regular.</p>

<p class='c011'>Since that time she has been living as cook in a family which
I frequently visit, and it is therefore certain that she remains
perfectly well.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Case XXXVIII. Severe and Frequent Epileptic Fits for Three Years and a Half—Operation—Cure.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>C. T., æt. 21; admitted into the London Surgical Home June
23, 1864.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—Health always good till three years ago, when, after a
severe fright, she became very excited and had a fit. Since that
time has been continually subject to them. She never passes a day
without two or three, and frequently has as many as six, or even
eight, in the twenty-four hours. Is most subject to them at night
when sleeping. Is always suffering from headache. Her mental
powers are somewhat impaired, as she has very slight recollection
of persons, or of events, from day to day. Catamenia very irregular.
Has not menstruated since March last. Bowels costive; pulse
regular and firm. Is of a sallow complexion, with vacant and weak
expression of countenance. Acknowledges great and constant irritation
of pudic nerve.</p>

<p class='c011'>During the day previous to operation, special notice was taken
of the nature of the fits. They are epileptic; for although she does
not foam at the mouth, she has, on more than one occasion, <em>bitten
her tongue</em>, and is <em>perfectly unconscious</em>. There is no rigidity, but
a constant struggling, and, unless restrained, the hands always,
during an attack, are carried to the seat of irritation.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>June 23. The usual operation of excision was performed under
chloroform. As soon as she recovered, she managed to remove the
dressings. Hæmorrhage for two hours was the result. When
arrested, two grains of opium were administered, which produced
sleep. On awaking, she again endeavoured to remove the dressings;
but, her hands being confined, she was unable to do so. She had
no more fits, and but a few hysterical attacks. On July 17th she
was discharged, as her parents were anxious for her return. She
had not then had a fit of any kind for sixteen days.</p>

<p class='c011'>August 15. I received the following letter from her father:—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Dear Sir,—It would be very unkind in me, and much out of
place, to hide from you and the world at large what have been my
feelings during the past three weeks. My daughter, C. T., came to
your Home, Stanley Terrace, Notting Hill, on the 23rd of June
last, to be treated by you for epilepsy, or epileptic fits, having been
afflicted for three years and a half. The class of fit you may better
judge of than myself; sufficient to say, they were very bad
and very frequent. I am happy to say, and acquaint you, that
since her return she has not had a single symptom of fit or hysteria
of any kind. Her general health is also very good, and fast improving,
and I do hope, by the blessing of God, she may continue
so. If you have any desire to see her, I shall feel in duty bound
to let her wait upon you, with her mother, at any time you may
think fit to appoint, as your opinion just at this time might have a
still more happy effect for the future. You are quite at liberty to
use this for the benefit of the Institution in whatever way you may
like or seem good.”</p>

<p class='c014'>A twelvemonth later, this patient was still free from any return
of the fits.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>A. H., æt. 17; admitted into the London Surgical Home June
28, 1864.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—Catamenia first appeared three years ago. They have
continued regular to the present time. About twelve months since
was observed, whenever sent on an errand from home, that she
would wander about in an absent manner, and return home having
forgotten all about any message which had been given her. About
this time fits were first developed; they increased in frequency
and intensity, and she now has them daily, and one or more of less
violent character nearly every night in her sleep. When seized,
she falls, struggles violently, foams at the mouth, often bites her
tongue, and is totally unconscious to all around her. After a fit,
she sinks into a deep sleep, which lasts for two hours. Has no
recollection on awaking of what has taken place. Acknowledges
to frequent injurious habits, but is unconscious of their being the
cause of her illness. Is vague in all her ideas and conversation,
and has almost entirely lost her memory.</p>

<p class='c011'>Both history and personal examination plainly showed what was
the cause of her attacks.</p>

<p class='c011'>On July 7 the clitoris was completely excised. She had no
return of the fits; and on the 23rd the following report appears in
the case-book:—“Left her bed to-day. Is greatly changed; quite
rational in all her movements; converses freely and quietly, remembers
passing events from day to day, and it is indeed almost
impossible to recognize in her the half-idiotic, almost demented
girl who entered the Home less than a month ago.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She remained in the Home some time longer for observation.
Fits never returned; her mind improved daily, and she was discharged
as perfectly cured.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>
  <h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Case XL. Epileptic Fits—Two Years and a Half Duration—Operation—Relief.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>S. Z., æt. 16, single; admitted into the London Surgical Home
October 20, 1865.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—Was strong and well until two and a half years ago,
when she had an epileptic fit in the middle of the night. Can
assign no cause for the attack. For a long time had a fit once a
month, but latterly once a week. The catamenia appeared six
months before the first fit, and have always been regular. There
is no exacerbation at menstrual epoch. Complains of great irritation
of pudendals for three years.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nov. 2. Since admission this patient has been watched: she
has had two fits, both of a genuine epileptic character.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Brown this day performed his usual operation. She went
on well till the 10th, when she had a slight fit; there being irresistible
irritation, the hands were restrained. A lotion of bromide
of ammonium was ordered to be applied to the wound, and 20
grains of the bromide to be given in water three times daily.</p>

<p class='c011'>She convalesced well, and had no more attacks till the 29th, when,
her hands having been released only a few minutes previously, she
had a fit, and the nurse found one hand on the wound. She was
conscious during the attack, which was not so violent as before
treatment.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dec. 2. Discharged relieved. If this patient could be under
control for a few months, she would probably be cured.</p>

<p class='c013'>M. F., æt. 44, single; admitted into the London Surgical Home
December 8, 1865.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—Epileptic fits first attacked her when she was about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>14, at which age she menstruated. For the first few years there
was a long interval between each, but they gradually became more
frequent and violent. Latterly she has had several during the
week of each menstrual period, and as a rule none in the interval.
Catamenia have been tolerably regular in appearance, but rather
profuse. Is tall, pale, and thin; has a dull and somewhat vacant
expression; is very eccentric in her manners and conversation; is
frequently observed, both day and night, by the nurses to practise
injurious habits, to which she acknowledges for the last thirty
years. The fits are genuine epileptic.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>On examination</em>, there is evidence of very long-continued peripheral
irritation, and also a fissure of rectum.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dec. 12. The usual operation on clitoris and rectum.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dec. 13. In the absence of nurse, removed the dressing, and
immediately had a fit. To have opium 1 grain, with ¼ grain of
extract of belladonna, every six hours.</p>

<p class='c011'>Under this treatment the patient improved daily, became cheerful,
rational, tractable, and much more sensible in her conversation.</p>

<p class='c011'>She passed two menstrual epochs, but without a fit, and she was
discharged perfectly cured.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have a much larger number of cases occurring

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <span class='large'>IDIOTCY AND INSANITY, WITH CASES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>As epilepsy is a much graver disease than
hysteria, so is the sequel of the former—dementia
or idiotcy—much more permanent and difficult
to be removed by treatment than insanity, which
is the ordinary sequel of hysteria.</p>

<p class='c008'>I shall give but one case of idiotcy, because I
regret to say that I have never yet been able to
thoroughly restore the mental powers in any patients
suffering from this dreadful affliction. Epilepsy is
such a chronic disease, and seems to me to produce
not only weakening of the mind, but to cause it to be
often entirely lost, that, although we may get, as in
the following case, a temporary re-kindling of the
mental energies, I fear we are not yet able to give
much hope of complete recovery. Even here, however,
I have such faith in the efficacy of perseverance
in constant watching, that I am almost inclined to
believe that, had this patient been in a condition of
life to ensure vigilant medical supervision for a
lengthened period after operation, we might at last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>have succeeded in, if not complete, at least, much
creator restoration than in a public institution, or to
those in humble circumstances, the surgeon is in a

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Case XLII. Epileptic Fits, with Complete Idiotcy—Operation—Great Temporary Relief, but not Permanent Benefit.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>Mary J., æt. 19, single; admitted into the London Surgical
Home Feb. 15, 1864.</p>

<p class='c011'>This patient was brought to me by Dr. Marley, with the following
account:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Has the appearance of a child of 10 or 12 years old; mammæ
not developed; has had epileptic fits ever since 12 years of age.
Is now almost idiotic; stares vacantly; slobbers at the mouth;
passes her motions anywhere, without regard to common decency,
and cannot retain her urine. I find from her mother that she
is incessantly irritating her genitals. Her fits vary in frequency,
from two or three a day to four or five a week. Being satisfied of
the cause of her fits, I sent her to you.”</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History</em>, taken at the Home from her mother.—Had perfect
health until she reached her eleventh year; was forward in her
lessons, and well educated for her age and position. At this time
she was suddenly seized with a severe fit, for which no cause could
be assigned. A period of two years elapsed before she had a
second, when, being placed under medical treatment for eighteen
months, she had great relief. Since the expiration of that time to
the present she has constantly suffered from fits.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her intellect did not begin to weaken until two years since, but
she ceased growing and learning after the first attack. At this
time she does not know her right hand from her left; does not
know her mother, and shows no signs whatever of ordinary intelligence.
From being cleanly as a child, is now most filthy—in fact,
is in every sense an idiot.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>Has never menstruated.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>On examination</em>—although, as stated by Dr. Marley, the mammæ
were very rudimentary—there was full development, and indeed
abnormal hypertrophy, of the external genitals.</p>

<p class='c011'>Feb. 18. The usual operation performed, under chloroform. The
hands to be restrained, and the patient most carefully watched.</p>

<p class='c011'>Feb. 19. Has passed a good night, and is quiet.</p>

<p class='c011'>Feb. 23. Has been very drowsy since the operation. To-day
asked for food for the first time, and showed some signs of intelligence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Feb. 26. Gave rational answers to several questions which were
asked her. Also remembers from day to day any promises of
delicacies of diet or money.</p>

<p class='c011'>March 1. Passed a good night; feels free from pain. Was
given some printed cards, which she read—<em>the first time for nine
years</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>March 2. Improving much. Is much more modest in her behaviour,
but still passes her excretions without regard to time or
place. Notices passing events, and remembers names and faces.</p>

<p class='c011'>March 3. Has given sensible and somewhat witty replies to
various questions asked her in the presence of about twenty medical
gentlemen, who to-day came to see the operation. When moneys
were given her, she at once told their different relative value.</p>

<p class='c011'>March 4. Morning: Seems no worse for the excitement of
yesterday.—Evening: Had a slight fit.</p>

<p class='c011'>March 5. A little heavy and stupid to-day. Somewhat irritable
and obstinate.</p>

<p class='c011'>March 6. Much better. Has a daily clearer notion of right
and wrong. Likes books with pictures and large print. When
she comes to hard words, she asks the meaning, like a child, but
cannot always grasp the meaning of an explanation.</p>

<p class='c011'>March 8. Not quite so well to-day. Had a slight epileptic fit
this evening, followed by a very severe one in two hours.</p>

<p class='c011'>March 9. Again much better, but irritable.</p>

<p class='c011'>March 16. Not so well: another fit to-day.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>She from this time seemed to retrograde; and on the 4th of
April was discharged as incurable.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will be recollected how, at the end of the chapter
on Hysteria, I gave three cases of extreme nervous
irritability, with sleeplessness, and tendency to an
unhinging of the mental equilibrium. We now come
to insanity itself. It would be vain to talk of the
varieties of forms in which this state may be seen,
when produced by abnormal peripheral irritation of
the pudic nerve. It is, however, worthy of notice
how each history seems to tell its own explanation of
the cause; and after the first few days of treatment,
when excitement, caused by irritation from the wound
and a natural repugnance to restraint, has passed off,
how rapid is the improvement, and how permanent is
the result. I have no hesitation in saying that in no
case am I so certain of a permanent cure as in acute
nympho-mania; for I have never after my treatment
seen a recurrence of the disease, whereas, under
medical treatment, of how short duration is but too
frequently the benefit.</p>

<p class='c013'>R. T., æt. 39, single; admitted into the London Surgical Home
Oct. 22, 1861.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—Has been ailing for many years, and given great
trouble and anxiety to her friends. For some time past she has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>been very strange in her manner, very restless, never quiet, constantly
wakeful, threatening suicide, talking to people, even perfect
strangers, of her ailments and their causes, of which she is fully
conscious. Was formerly modest and quiet.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>On examination</em>, she is a fine woman, of restless appearance and
manner; eye wandering and unsteady; pupil dilated. The cause
of her mental derangement being obvious, on</p>

<p class='c011'>Oct. 24 the usual operation was performed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The improvement in her mental and bodily health was wonderful:
she gained flesh, and became cheerful and modest. She was discharged
six weeks after admission.</p>

<p class='c011'>When heard of in February, 1863, this patient continued quite
well.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first case of actual insanity that came under
my care was a patient of Dr. Warren Diamond, then
resident in his private asylum. I cannot do better
than transcribe the account which he sent me with

</div>

<p class='c013'>“Miss E. R., æt. 34, single; no occupation, living with her friends;
hair light reddish-brown; face set and vacant, with an occasional
pained expression; eyes fixed and dull; extremities damp and cold;
stature moderate and well formed. Has for several years past been
looked on by her friends as different from others—strange and
eccentric. Would go out and walk away into the country alone
for miles, and come back exhausted. When friends called, would
start up and run round the garden, or to the top of the house and
back again, giving no reason for it but that she must do it. Always
exceedingly irritable and passionate. Unless some excitement was
going on, was listless and unable to rouse herself. When at parties,
was so forward and open in her manners, that she was generally
avoided by gentlemen. <em>Never had an offer of marriage.</em> Her
mother died about a year and a half ago, but she took no notice of
the occurrence, and was consequently remarked on by her friends.
Since then she has been getting more strange and peculiar. About
February last, a sister told her, in joke, that if she did not take
care she would soon become a fit subject for Dr. Diamond, little
thinking how soon it would happen. She recently made enemies
of old friends, so that her brothers could not make out why they
fell off. Would sit or stand without noticing them when they
called; and asked them what they wanted that they came to her
house (she was the eldest of the family).</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was consulted about her in the end of March, but had then
none of her previous history. She was vacant and dreamy; talked
of flowers which she called her friends; said ‘people’s faces were
masks; that she was quite unable to rouse or employ herself, as
she was changed;’ very uncertain in appetite, going a day without
her food; not sleeping at night, and for the last few nights showing
such great excitement and passion, that her sisters were required
to sit up with her.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>“I recommended change along the south coast, with sea-bathing,
&amp;c. She did not improve; and the attendant informing me of a
constant irritation of the vulva, lotions were used, but without
benefit. Her general health and appetite improved; but not the
mind. She could not sleep, and would not bear narcotics; <em>stimulants
acted as narcotics</em>, but soon lost their effect.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bowels regular; pulse small and slow; action of heart being
irritable, and not corresponding at all times to the power or quantity
of the pulse. She sits up in bed, nursing the pillow, and
talking to it as if it were a baby; says ‘that she died last Sunday’—‘is
lost’—‘is buried.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“When out of doors, great difficulty is experienced in getting her
in again; she wishes to wander away, without aim or purpose.
Having given my opinion to her friends, I was authorized to admit
her April 18, 1861. Before she left home, she continued calling
out, ‘Take me to a mad-house! take me quick, or I shall never get
well!’ She persisted in saying ‘she was dead,’ and ‘she felt
buried.’ Answers in monosyllables. Her pupil is contracted and
fixed. At night she does not sleep, and is in such a continual state
of excitement that the attendant cannot sleep with her. Has lost
all natural modesty in manner and speech. Is not blasphemous.
Before me is perfectly reserved and correct in her manner. When
I ask questions, she will, after a pause, answer in monosyllables, or
repeat the question over and over again, as if trying to grasp the
meaning and ally her thoughts. Unless walked about, will stand
for hours in one place, gaping, yawning, and throwing her arms
about listlessly. She was in this state when you saw her, and from
what you told me of your experience of the operation and its
results, I was led to infer relief from it in this case, as the delusion
of having died on a certain day was movable and could be
reasoned away; but the heavy oppressed feeling still made her say,
‘But if I am not dead, I am lost, or changed,’ and naturally led
back to the idea. I ascribed the state of her mind to weakening of
the body, and general nervous irritation caused by long-continued
reflex excitation; and I believed that if the source of irritation could
be removed, her mental health would follow as her blood became
healthy, and fit to make reparation.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“I was led to think more of her uterine state from her expression
of pain when she was walked about, and she was reported by the
nurse as always complaining of her back, at the lower part, and of
great tenderness on pressure over the ovaries.</p>

<p class='c011'>“May 27, 1861. You operated on her, she being under the influence
of chloroform. She was naturally restless afterwards, not
understanding why she was kept in bed. Profuse menstruation
came on in the evening, which had not happened for four months
previously, and then always very scanty and with much pain. Half
an ounce of laudanum, with oil, was rubbed into her chest during
four hours; she did not, however, sleep, but continued moaning all
night.</p>

<p class='c011'>“May 28. Easier, and more herself—takes her food.</p>

<p class='c011'>“May 29. Slept well last night, without opiates; says she shall
now get well and be able to go home; answers questions more
readily, and makes longer replies. <em>Pupil dilated and acts slowly.</em>
Her nurse says she is quite altered in every way, and compares the
change in her mind since the operation to ‘dividing the tightened
strings of a fiddle, and letting them all loose.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“June 2. Left her bed; is still menstruating; appears cheerful;
asks questions now, and converses for short periods; has done a
few stitches of needlework; says nothing about ‘being lost or
dead’ since the operation. Surface of body and extremities warm.
Freaky, anxious look about her eyes and nose gone. Laughs and
jokes. Says ‘she has been in a dream,’ ‘that things now seem
light,’ and ‘that she means to get well.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“July 3. She has gradually improved and become more natural
in her habits and ideas; sleeps soundly every night; takes her
meals well; walks about without compulsion; takes a pride in
making herself neat, and has washed and dressed herself ever since
she left her bed; is perfectly modest in manner and conversation.
Her friends remark on the great improvement in her mind, she
having had no delusions. Her mental state is, however, weak—what
might better be called foolish, with some amount of wilful
obstinacy. The family medical attendant, and, in fact, every one
who has been in her company, notice the extraordinary change
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>that has taken place in her since your operation. I think the
present state of her mind results from the long-continued exhaustion,
and to restore it will be a matter of time. Her pupils act
naturally.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I have often since heard of this lady as perfectly well, and as
never having had recurrence of illness. In 1865 I was consulted
on the propriety of marriage, to which I gave my full consent.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Case XLV. Acute Insanity—Two Months—Operation—Cure.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>Miss ——, æt. 17, moderate height, and well formed, hair light
golden, grey eyes and fair complexion, came under my care June
19, 1861.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History</em> (taken from her mother).—When ten years old, had inflammation
of the womb, and after she recovered began to menstruate.
The function continued regularly until about eight months
ago, since when the catamenia have appeared every ten days, and,
in fact, have been hardly ever absent. In the latter part of last
April she left home for change of air, and returned May 15th,
when her mother noticed that she was thinner than before her
departure, and, on inquiry, it appeared that during the latter part
of her stay she had been very excited, at other times very low,
sometimes laughing and singing, and requiring port wine and
brandy at all times of the day, though generally abstemious, and
never taking wine or other stimuli. The first night after her return
home she went to one of her sisters’ rooms and began to talk of being
married; did not sleep all that night. May 17th. Was found to
be rather wild in the morning; was taken out for a drive during
the day; did not sleep that night, from constant excitement of the
genitals. Had been seen by her ordinary medical attendant, who
ordered opiates, but without the effect of giving her sleep. On the
28th, another physician saw her, and ordered opiates, but without
effect, as she did not have an hour’s sleep night or day. May 22nd.
An eminent authority in female diseases was called in, and also,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>among other remedies, ordered opiates at night-time, but with no
effect. She continued raving and rambling till June 8th, when a
physician, who devotes himself to mental diseases, saw her; he
said that her mind was not affected, but that her behaviour was
caused simply by debility, and ordered wine, eggs, &amp;c., and a <em>strong
opiate</em>, but without the desired effect.</p>

<p class='c011'>June 17. Was much worse. The last physician again saw her;
said that she was quite mad, must be taken from home, and could
never recover. She called her mother “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur le Diable</span>,” and
her father “God.” She was constantly irritating her clitoris, and
indulged in most immodest behaviour. Was ordered ext. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cannabis
indicæ</span>, and slept three hours. 19th. No better, and on this day I
first saw her; she was then wild in expression of countenance, and
on entering the room she addressed me as “Your Majesty,” and said
“I was the Queen.” She also asked, “Why has your Majesty condescended
to visit me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>June 21. Before operating, the patient being under chloroform,
I made an examination, and found my diagnosis verified by the
existence of all the ordinary local symptoms. The hymen was quite
absent. (In one of her paroxysms she had stuffed a pocket handkerchief
into the vagina.) I performed my usual operation, and immediately
administered two grains of opium. She passed a tolerable
night, not being noisy, but not sleeping.</p>

<p class='c011'>June 22. Tolerably quiet. Not aware of what is passing around
her, but apparently comfortable. To have broth and milk diet—<em>no
stimulants</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>June 23. Passed a quiet night; but did not sleep much, though
she had a grain of opium. Dressing removed. Wound looking
well.</p>

<p class='c011'>June 24. Has not passed quite such a good night—rather noisy.</p>

<p class='c011'>June 25. Menses came on. Has had a very bad night, and
been very troublesome. Chloroform administered to insensibility
several times in the course of the day. A liniment, containing
seven drachms of soap liniment and one drachm of laudanum, to
be rubbed in to the chest constantly. This seemed to quiet her.</p>

<p class='c011'>June 27. Has passed a rather better night, sleeping a little; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>towards morning she became very noisy, and chloroform was again
administered. To have the liniment rubbed in at night.</p>

<p class='c011'>June 28. A much better night.</p>

<p class='c011'>June 29. Has had a very fair night; and from this time she
gradually improved, sleeping well and being generally quite rational;
her appetite also improved.</p>

<p class='c011'>July 7. Menstruation occurred, and she was not so well for a
day or two, as she attempted to irritate the wound; but, being
carefully watched, was prevented.</p>

<p class='c011'>July 10. Catamenia ceased. Is quiet again.</p>

<p class='c011'>July 11. Went out in a bath chair, and said she enjoyed the
airing. From this time she gradually got better, and on the 28th
she went into the country for change. Her menses came on five
weeks from the last appearance; she was quite quiet all the time.
Since then she has menstruated regularly every three weeks, and
in normal quantity.</p>

<p class='c011'>A year after operation she had a slight relapse of melancholy,
and fears were entertained that she was again going to be ill; but a
brisk purgation of calomel completely dispersed all symptoms.</p>

<p class='c011'>1866. I have frequently heard of this young lady. She is now
in good health, moving in high society, and universally admired.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Case XLVI. Hysterical Homicidal Mania—One Year’s Duration—Operation—Cure.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>In December, 1861, Mrs. —— came under my care, by the recommendation
of Dr. Forbes Winslow. She gave me the following
history of herself:—</p>

<p class='c011'><em>History.</em>—She was 57, and had had four children and two premature
labours. The last child was born twenty-three years ago.
Twenty months since had an attack of erysipelas in the face, with
eruptions on different parts of the body. Has never been well
since, and last August had another attack of erysipelas. Is constantly
suffering with shiverings, followed by burning heat and
sweating, with prickling heat of the skin. For the last year has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>never slept for more than an hour; always waking with a <em>start</em>;
feeling frantic, and very hot and flushed. Has a constant feeling
that she will be lost eternally, and of this she is constantly
speaking.</p>

<p class='c011'>From her husband I learnt the following:—</p>

<p class='c011'>After her last confinement, twenty-three years ago, she had
puerperal mania, from which she did not completely recover for
six months. About a year ago she began to show symptoms of
mental derangement, first exhibited in religious subjects, she constantly
declaring that her soul was irrevocably lost. About eight
months ago she first tried to destroy herself, by endeavouring to
jump out of the window, &amp;c., and it was at this time thought advisable
to place her in an asylum, where she was kept four months,
and when she left she was for a time much better. While an
inmate of the asylum, was made to take much exercise, for which
her husband says she is always better.</p>

<p class='c011'>She gradually got worse, and came under the care of Dr. Forbes
Winslow, to whom I am indebted for the case. Her husband
says that for the last two or three months she has slept pretty well
from 10 p.m. till 2 a.m., when she would suddenly wake, and warn
him that a “frenzy” was coming on. This frenzy consisted in her
rising up, fighting out with her arms, and scratching or tearing any
one near her; in the paroxysm the desire was always to destroy
her husband. After a few minutes the mania would subside, and
be succeeded, first by a kind of stupor, and then very profuse
perspirations. One peculiarity about her is, that when in this
state she does or says anything foolish, she knows it, and is afterwards
very annoyed and ashamed of her conduct. She has a great
fear that she will be permanently mad.</p>

<p class='c011'>The appetite has always been good, though she has said lately
that she cannot bear food, and that it always causes a horrid taste
in her mouth. She has, in a desultory manner, read many medical
works, and fancies that every one of her organs is in some way or
other diseased.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>On examination</em>, she had the appearance of a woman about 60.
Her eyes, of a dark grey, were never quiet, and could not look you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>straight in the face; the pupil was much and constantly dilated.
The tongue quite clean, and pulse good. Heart, lungs, and other
organs seemed to be healthy. She owned with great shame to
long-continued pernicious habits.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dec. 14. I performed my usual operation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dec. 21. Has very much improved, and had no “frenzies”
since the operation; sleeps well, and for many hours, but will not
own to being better. Complains of her skin being dry, and
“burning hot.” It is, however, moist and cool; at times she
perspires freely.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dec. 26. Both husband and nurse consider her much improved.
She has been up both yesterday and to-day; sleeps and eats well.
She is, however, sulky; says she is very bad, and shall soon die.</p>

<p class='c011'>A fortnight later she was quite well, being entirely free since the
operation from maniacal attacks; but she complained to my son,
Mr. Boyer Brown, that I had unsexed her. He answered that
nothing of the sort had been done, but that the operation had
prevented her from making herself ill. From this time she steadily
improved, and walked out with her husband every day, who called
on me many weeks later to express his gratitude for the complete
restoration of his wife to health; for whereas before his nights
were passed in constant fear, rendering his life most wretched, his
home was now one of comfort and happiness both night and day.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Case XLVII. Acute Hysterical Mania—Four Months’ Duration—Operation—Cure.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>Miss ——, æt. 23, was sent to me by Mr. Radcliffe, stating
that she had been brought over from Ireland as an insane patient,
and that everything had been settled for her admission to some
asylum, when he was induced to consult me on the last day before
her entering one. He stated that the paroxysms always came on
at half-past five or six every evening: I replied, if the attacks
depended on peripheral irritation, that an operation would at once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>prevent recurrence of the attacks. She was accordingly admitted
into the London Surgical Home Feb. 6, 1864.</p>

<p class='c011'>When admitted, said she had taken no food for three days, and
asked for a cup of tea, which was given her. Enema was also
administered.</p>

<p class='c011'>3.45 p.m. Was seized with a fit, throwing her arms up over
her head, and then appearing as if comatose. In about twenty
minutes revived: the lips began to quiver, and she gradually
became conscious, saying, “I want a knife—I want blood!” She
asked for the matron’s hand, that she might bite it off.</p>

<p class='c011'>[The fit coming on earlier on this day was doubtless due to
excitement consequent on her removal.]</p>

<p class='c011'>5 p.m. Mr. Baker Brown saw her; as soon as he came near
her, she seized his shoulder with great violence; was wild, and
would not answer questions; but gradually became soothed, and
allowed an examination.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Externally</em>, the abdomen showed signs of a child having been
born, and the mammæ had certainly contained milk. The <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">clitoris</span></i>
was enlarged and hard; the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nymphæ</span></i> long and flabby; the mucous
membrane roughened and discoloured.</p>

<p class='c011'><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Per vaginam</span></i>, the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">uterus</span></i> was found to be retroverted; there was
also a fissure of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">rectum</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Operation</em>, 5.30 p.m. Was very violent under the first attempts
to administer chloroform. She was long in being brought under
its influence, but when once thoroughly anæsthetized, bore it
exceedingly well.</p>

<p class='c011'>The clitoris was excised, the elongated nymphæ removed, and
the fissure of the rectum divided. The wounds were dressed in
the usual manner, and the patient having had two grains of opium
administered, was ordered to be constantly watched.</p>

<p class='c011'>In twenty minutes awoke from the chloroform. Was calm, and
slept at intervals during the night.</p>

<p class='c011'>Feb. 7, 10 a.m. Visited by Mr. B. Brown. Present—Mr. I. B.
Brown, junior, House-Surgeon, and Matron. Pulse quick but
steady; tongue brown and furred; breath offensive; gums spongy;
pupil natural; countenance rather flushed; skin moist and warm.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>The following answers were given to questions asked of her by
Mr. Brown, seventeen hours after operation, and are in her own
words; much, however, of the information was volunteered without
questions:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Last March, instead of sliding down a slope, I jumped. This
caused displacement of my womb. I suffered great agonies. I
was fomented with hot water. I thought it was my back that
was hurt. Since then I have been subject to fainting and weakness.
I suffer great irritation about my private parts—cannot
keep my hands away. The irritation is worse at night. I am
obliged to relieve the irritation by rubbing—sometimes for two or
three minutes at a time. There is always a discharge. I feel
very depressed afterwards. At times I have lost my brain, and
felt as if I did not care for living. I would like to have my hands
untied; I will be very quiet. Have been separated from my
relatives for three years. I shan’t tell you how long I have been
married—(a pause). I am very rude—I beg your pardon. I have
been married three years. I had a baby two years ago: it was
not born at the full time—I think five months. I don’t know
whether it was alive. I left home with my friend when I was
sixteen (?). It is two years since I left him. I am now twenty-three.</p>

<p class='c011'>“After the accident, suffered great pain.” Mr. Brown here
looked at her gums, and she immediately said, “Oh, yes; I had
mercury given me by Surgeon ——, in Dublin: he said it was
my spine. He did not examine my womb. Dr. —— examined
it, and said there was great displacement. I have been better for
treatment at times. My brain has been affected. I have fought
very much. I have wanted a child’s blood. I have had it sometimes
by sucking the wounds of a child. When in a fit, I don’t
know what is going on around, or what is being said, but I recognize
people’s voices. I am not regular. Was kept in bed last
September for six weeks for flooding; was so for ten days after I
was put in bed. Was the same in Paris last year. I was studying
in Paris to fit myself for a governess.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The following are extracts from a letter voluntarily sent to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Mr. Brown by a lady with whom the patient lived for many months,
and left only three weeks previous to admission. Having stated
that for some time she was hysterical, and becoming daily more
excitable, the letter says—</p>

<p class='c011'>“On the 13th of September last, she for the first time seemed
delirious when going to bed. This was mentioned next morning
to Surgeon ——, who declared it to be nervous irritability of the
spine.... On the 27th, Dr. —— was called in, and at once gave
his opinion that there was ailment of the womb. He then ordered
small blisters on the lower part of the stomach, which in less than
ten hours relieved her, and removed the mania. She had not any
reason for <em>many</em> days previous, and was sinking.... On the 3rd
of October, Dr. —— fixed an instrument to support the womb;
and, except during the time when the intensity of pain caused it,
there was no delirium; for a few days she got claret, which seemed
to excite her greatly, so it was discontinued; but on the 13th of
October I was desired to give her port wine in abundance. She
was excessively weak, and mania so dreadful, that she made several
attempts to injure herself and me. She got as many as eight large
glasses of best port on some days; strong beef-tea, chicken soup,
and all the nourishment possible. It was not only suggested, but
it was advised to remove her to a lunatic asylum; however, feeling
that certainly nine-tenths of her time she was perfectly sane, and
could know well where she was and with whom, I did not like the
idea of placing so young a creature in an asylum. I kept her here,
and watched her day and night; she never was left alone for one
moment for three months.... I ought to mention that the order
for abundance of wine, &amp;c., was from the opinion that ‘want of
blood to the brain’ caused the mania; and that the intense inflammation
of all internal organs was relieved by blisters on the
lower part of the stomach and by mercury.”</p>

  <h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Case XLVIII. Incipient Mania—One Year’s Duration—Operation—Cure—Subsequent Pregnancy.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In 1863, Mrs. S. M., married, mother of three children, æt. 30,
came under my care, because she had been suffering for more than
a year from menorrhagia, which had gradually affected her mind,
causing her to have a great distaste for her husband; so much so,
that he and his friends were induced seriously to contemplate a
separation. On the first examination, her face indicated mental
disturbance, eyes restless, pupils dilated, and manner generally
excitable. She told me that she could not sleep at night, complained
of constant weary uneasiness in her womb, pain in her
back, great pain on defecation, constant desire to micturate. She
said she was glad to be away from home, as she made every one
around her unhappy. Believed that she would be a permanently
insane patient, and never expected to return to her family again.</p>

<p class='c011'>On more minute examination, I found irritable clitoris and labia,
a painful fissure of the rectum, with great relaxation of the sphincter
ani, which, on inquiry, was found to be caused by the frequent
introduction of her finger, with a view to peripheral irritation. At
her own request, she had long been separated <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">à mensâ</span></i> from her
husband, on account of her great distaste for him and cohabitation
with him.</p>

<p class='c011'>I pursued the usual surgical treatment, which was followed by
uninterrupted success; and after two months’ treatment, she returned
to her husband, resumed cohabitation, and stated that all
her distaste had disappeared; soon became pregnant, resumed her
place at the head of her table, and became a happy and healthy
wife and mother. She was in due time safely delivered, and has
ever since remained in perfect health.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Remarks.</em>—From observations of this case, one feels compelled
to say, may not it be typical of many others where there is a judicial
separation of husband and wife, with all the attendant domestic
miseries, and where, if medical and surgical treatment were brought
to bear, all such unhappy measures would be obviated?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>A careful perusal of the cases related in the
foregoing pages will show that all the theoretical
objections mentioned in the introductory chapter, as
having been raised against my treatment, have been
fully contradicted by facts. Of the permanency of
the result, I myself am fully satisfied; and I hope at
a future time, by a much larger number of cases, to
confirm others in the same opinion.</p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
